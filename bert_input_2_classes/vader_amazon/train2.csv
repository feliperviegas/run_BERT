0,1,also happen recording jazz set number outtakes song without numbering separately
0,1,also cant understand software ignore lists cds alphabetical order
0,1,words locate track using software computer add playlist must know name cd appears find track locating location unlisted cd looking tracks appear
1,0,dont problem make playlist nomad cds listed separately
0,1,need computer however want add tracks playlist
