shopped amazon happy performance thus far
picture web site clearly play display pictured yet false silver plate
clearly large lawsuit inclined
also 3999 rebate free shipping tax overall decent player
noiseless lightweight oh yeah
excellent picture quality color recently purchased canon powershot g3 extremely satisfied purchase
im easily enlarging pictures 12 11 visable loss picture quality even using best possible setting yet super fine
things didnt like hey
main dial backlit
couple online camera review sites extremely helpful provided complete exhaustive reviews nearly every camera made plus provided great number high resolution sample images compare amongst models
wont go details online sites stevesdigicams dpreviews go great depth reviews pleased features speed picture quality flexibility automation functional conveniences camera offers
panoramic stitch mode guides stitching together multiple pictures build seamless panoramic image
havent practice im already love camera one full day say wonderful
focusing system also flexible
move focus range almost anywhere scene push button onscreen manual focus mode would really helpful shooting scene tough automatically focus
megapixels enough anybody photo quality awesome
extended zoom range faster lense put top class
expect g3 please years come
time wanted wife intimidated knobs buttons
prints beautiful
although canons batteries proprietary last really long time recharge fairly quickly camera plus want power even find knockoff charger spare batteries right amazon
love slr 35mm need go digital great camera
warning read manual
read manual able point shoot without fumble around trying figure controls located
quick spin dial select shutter priority high speed subjects aperture priority focal length full program mode camera selects ideal photo quality
feel like holding something substance cheap plastic toy
seriously thing everything pro expert amateur could want
know five mp cameras thing fine
looking simple point shoot camera probably looking
love new received camera two days ago already love features
overall best camera market
wish canon would work way issue
wanted shoot concerts well
sure adjusted film speed 400 grain terrible
dont need extra resolution cost
going leica minilux g3 replacing mine stolen
hence decided spring pointandshoot digicam would features would let get around inherent limitations
chose g3 reputation high quality clean images
least youve got focus lock shutter release lag time g3 110 second ive read better anything else available
relative easily achieve external flash nikon slr internal flash g3 produces harsh flat images ugly hot spots
cant use nikon external flash canon camera use metz proper metz module extension cord connected g3 60 ct4
metz flash 45cl3 would like get absolute ultimate quality g3 metz module need sca 3102 connector cord sca 3000c
contrary ive read elsewhere g3 sync 1250 second thirdparty flashes dedicated flashes canon
forget controls metz flash head sca 3102 control panel ignored
might happen get close subject bounceflashing bounce flashing walls simply far away
results shadowfree images look theyve exposed gentlest natural light could imagine
maybe delete files looked software youd see true raw image camera actually produces
adobe camera raw plugin shows hardware miles ahead software
battery life drawback digital cameras quote reeves
good months worth research buying similar priced digital cameras best buy buck
great digital camera reading positive review camera leading consumer magazine decided head amazon read online reviews
im glad
canon never fails amaze
looks sort like picasa software google dont know interface easy install operate g2s intuitive
new photostich software stiching pics panoramic view
looks quite neat suggesting canon may er canonized bit
english means even straight box youll amazed pics end taking
theres really little g3 images criticize
ive tried sony s85 carl zeiss lens pictures digital
dont need go exhustive review camera
im concerned easily removed lens cap may damage lens
cheaply made
body construction buttons casing etc plastic
g2 better respect
heavier sturdy casing
despite grieps still recommend camera
flaws learned deal took thousands pictures around world losing really regretted
researched held tested observed different brands
another point note battery life incredible
one little minor flaw camera lens visible viewfinder detract image
g3 looks like work art
save computer print ones want
get canon 850 printer ex flash
however 600 800 budget think camera excellent choice
one bad thing comes pitiful 32mb compactflash card purposes enough
cannon owned camera short time wouldnt give anything
wife never used camera picked soon got hang fact dont like created delete try
function lever one switches capture view mode feels fragile
flash builtin flashes small cameras get overilluminated main subjects depth lost
image quality excellent
macro works great medical photographs auto mode terrific point shoot
anyways canon improved upon g2 g3
charging card camera expedited shipping business days later still hadnt shipped product
cancelled order
hope get refund timely manner
minute trying tell people use lcd view finder finally admitted design flaw camera
moveable lcd screen great
tiny postagestamp sized remote unit wonderful trigger shutter also used zoom review pictures
body construction general quite bit plastic disappointment stainless steel heft s330
dont gray card use plain white piece paper
also discovered exposurebracket setting enables take three exposures one press shutter first exposure one lighter one darker
buy telephoto lens required extension
easy use
ill probably also get wideangle
camera need study use order fully exploit many features
simply canon g3 best digital camera today price point
even shortcomings still think best digital camera available 1200
pictures razorsharp even macro
light enough carry around day without bother
operating many features easy often obvious im annie lebovitz able figure abilities messing around camera store
easy use yet feature rich
battery life good got 90 minutes lcd turned time first time around using lcd every yet needed recharge
near perfection love photography
older camera simply point shoot camera
everything could took many days frustration concluding way transfer pc card reader
card reader included
used lexar 256 mb still use means nothing wrong lexar
isnt direct way add date time got say print images different directory option specify date time even slightest shakes totally distorts image

overall nikon 4300 dependable robust useful little camera
speaker phone functional use car audible even freeway noise
infrared blessing previous nokia want transfer old phone book phone saved hours reentering numbers
combination nokia 6610 tmobile service signal price service winner highly recommend
heres brief synopsis phone tiny cute feels kind plasticlike might break seems pretty sturdy
buttons phone small even small fingertips get used rather quickly
since received phone spent countless hours phone customer service reps promised tzones would work 24 hours
must heard dozen times span weeks tzones never worked
also theyd forgotten add wap capability service duh took another 45 days figuring
annoying habit asking theyve answered questions even didnt always seem expect yes answer
realize quality assurance purposes right say questions answered ie
csr im sure
one csr insisted trying get say hed answered questions interaction described well annoying
tzones
im staying sprint though fear csr isnt nearly good tmobiles clarity reception exceptional
ive bought expensive sanyo 5500vm4500 love im okay services

best regards sadoun satellite sales
best best mobile phone
features one would need cellphone
fm radio option listen music anytime
could get one camera scored competitors enjoying phone lot
love fact carry shirt pants pocket forget

pc cable expensive 50 usb cable
6610 still easier use two phones t610 t720i
battery nokia samsung sony phones last days provided dont talk much
motorolla phone horrible battery lasts day although heard motorolla t722i much longer battery life
also stock tracking app built also useless somewhat useful application converts types metrics currency length area etc

bluetooth functionality would made phone even better
service great far tell features work like charm ringtones high quality buy tmobile aim great

sound quality excellent except maybe tad quiet times quieter talkers end line
best phone best phone cheap free
radio feature superb sound quality
classic design yet looks hip
battery alot better phones
every tmobile plan comes gsm data meaning instead speeds 56 kbps around kbps small size wap websites really think makes difference
tmobiles might best reception areas amazing phones nokia 6610 cheap plans get way minutes plans
thought getting phone buy
phone great whole like others one two good qualities
reason many contractor subs carriers benifit mobile mobile features companies offering
beside prob
using gprs option pay 1999 extra month unlimited internet access added account
phone may look large small smaller 3390 phone
battery life good phone size
model traditional key arrangement really close one another unconventional shapes takes big getting used someone like big hands
fair said many korean imports nokias build quality light years ahead koreans
network coverage sporadic network always seems overloaded resulting unpleasant calling experience
using found size perfect carrying pocket
phone several color schemes choose
also assign special rings graphics special people call
massive phonebook hold 300 entries multiple phone number per entry program bosss home work cellphone numbers one contact
know find pretty quick
questions problems quickly satisfactorily resolved
different people different needs course tmobile plans priced well minutes services receive
light weight good signal strength
go
flaws machine xtra gets five stars affordability
yes ipod smaller 200 worth premium youll pay equivalent capacity model
problem accessories yet
cant complain recommend players hope remote come soon
get woth every penny
want poser follow herd mooooooh buy ipod
battery replaceable real plus leather case another real plus
way looks nice also
would given thing 45 stars since cant ill sweet give full stars
finally stumbling upon zen nx player knew found looking
doesnt firewire real complaint since windows users dont generally firewire cards
mention actually change battery
listening
probably would liked player something silver metallic like battery adapters usb thumbdrive muvo nx mp3 player models
since front plate removable access battery compartment aftermarket alternate covers would difficult expensive make
way better ipod
problems following installation instructions
downside see doesnt look like manage playlists nomad done computer
unlike ipod fully windows compatible used right box
one thing note product one day many options explored
despite instructions insisting process fairly automatic install usb drivers nomad interface software manually
scroll button overly sensitive times sensitive enough others
scroll bar problems make task creating playlists frustrating
positive side sound player pretty good everything configured
overall disappointing product
players mechanics also flawed
came price player hard beat
transfered 40 cds plenty space left
apples solution pay apple another 400 new ipod less paltry discount
bluescreen display zennx xtra model improvement toggle switch still tricky
update apple recently announced 107 replace battery ipods shipped factory
subject headphones thing seems like normal mp3 player use headphones give box invest 30 dollars nice pair sound quality goes roof
impressed
sleek amp stylish well screen options visuals
limited 999 files playlist archos os many want
really recommend anyone need new player
getting program install properly living hell experience
going try online download see works
getting files onto quick painless
sorting files easy pie
also sound wonderful gripe aweful earphones came
last mp3 players screen drove nuts
ipod uses smaller expensive drive 18
point new rio karma 280 reviewed readily good better areas ipod
cant believe people continue pay prices
ipod vs nomad zen xtra originally purchase 30 gb nomad zen xtra portable mp3 player
4000 mp3s never got 500 transfered
navigion little quirky still operates better zens
got every song downloaded player within day
first cons tad bulky asthetic looking player doesnt support folder stucture
pro way less expensive ipod
go chose one options dont need anything done
course unlike person mention upgraded firmware 123
update firmware upgrading drivers decide need newer drivers pc
mediasource flaky crashing explorer twice within first hour crash didnt require reboot another reboot hasnt crashed since
easy learn amp use intuitive enough even novice
urgent issue still works buttons pretty sensitive touch work well
ill see becomes problem road
yes
unlike mp3 players thing work properly id3 tags tracks
used explorer program move songs player
dial original zen perfect wish model
windows xp pro installing enclosed software receive message problem installing driver
quickly easily fixed going creative web site downloaded installed updated driver
found using supplied mediasource software easy
found using mediasource load songs nomad jukebox much easier faster using windows explorer
highlight songs want transfer playlist music library click one button done
good value
nice palm sized unit somewhat bigger ipod issue youre going try amp jog something
eax settings somewhat superfluous really negative
depressingly poor quality
receiving box amazon proceeded charging unit specified hours installed software connected unit pc via usb 20 pc quickly picked attempted install software failed creative chose follow microsoft standards whatever
strange noises obvious defects would accepted replacement clearly defective inferior operating system one intend waiting patches
plugged
received gift
better deleting reripping new title transferring player
transfers surprisingly quick usb 20 great sounding even supplied earbuds
definitely opening possibilities obtaining mp3s would never purchased cd
dissapointments
scroll wheel blunt sucks
screen covered make new selections open
owned mp3 players waiting matured since received gift one
know rush market new products
difficulties tags
summary overall like unit
gave stars due fact 1st one broke dropped fairly short distance less ft
believe napster mp3 player feature
sitting train fell lap broke
think fell right earphone plug fell murphy strikes
purchased extended warranty something almost never returned unit get replacement
updating units firmware first purchased unit downloaded firmware update available website
storage storage capacity great
im starting listen cds havent listened years handy one place
discovered weekend itunes sell mp3s mp3 format
sound sound player ok little disappointed low end
buy separate headphones recommended
able improve things bit using units equalizer boosting base
slowly yet surely unit engorged read review similar look mirror
little light
sure enough ability
creative talking updating via firmware however following descussion groups nomad players looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes firmware updates much new features
software comes player good
artist album genre mp3 tags supported buy player 100 artists would good another subcategory
bottom line ill still watch progress iriver hdd players produce 40 gb player ill sell nomad buy iriver
bundled software blows yes heard notmad explorer creative tech support people
yes software bundled creative products useless ugly
originally wanted ipod
sound excellent battery life excellent fact battery replacable excellent finally price 200 cheaper 40gb ipod excellent
thing ipod nomad style size ease use
possible fix notmad explorer red chair software
thank much go get nomad
course
another irriation hold scroll button long keeps going past song may wanted stop
sound quality excellent everything would expect company
although supplied software annoying times whole excellent
fast
btw sure mp3 tags labled correctly ensure great organization
often mentioned scroll tab average however difficult use horrible
isnt need get details remember rocks price sound ease use features
zx boasts superior sound quality ipod however compromises bit units size
lcd larger previous model nx bright blue backlight illuminates screen successfully nxs green backlight
scroll wheel easy use works great however many complained wheel cumbersome difficult operate
software hasnt hassle
sister able figure well average computer competence
prospective buyers would warn following purchase better pair headphones soon possible earbuds sound terrible terribly uncomfortable applies earbuds general make sure mp3s id3 tags loaded playlist automatically sort
want great sound quality dont want spend arm leg pergigabyte dont mind something iconoclast among many ipod users willing sacrifice cubic centimeters personal space large discount would suggest zen xtra
read instuctions plug zen computer installed software onto computer rebooted
scroll button seems ok problems
simple use
summary lots flaws exceptional sound quality hd size price make good buy
distortion sounded great especially eax environmental audio enabled
huge storage space even 320kbs store ton songs thing
30gb enough people
way could get rid walkman alltogether
software software crap
controls bit awkward
controls definately took getting used
first kept finding look nomad figure skip button
would replace better sounding comfortable phones
would much preferred keypadtype navigator like found dvd remotes
10 gb ipod much heard multiple sources ipod loud heard hard drive everytime spins accesses files antyhing
think reson creative larger sound dampening protection whihc plus speculation
well simple task
ipod amount memory 150 cheaper
refuse buy anything made apple nomad 200 cheaper anyway
havent messed firmware player worked perfect right box
battery lasts long playing music writing files player drains battery fast need plugged outlet sending files
software couldnt better mp3 player works like dream couldnt give anything wish
3a
well beginning asking around mp3 players
well one con really plug play first mean confusing start program one breeze
enjoy
like usual also customize sound player like would sound concert hall jazz club etc
really cool
also store data plus
transfer software hellishly horrible experience also players software
first many actions player utilizes dont make sense bookmarks example excellent feature player rather creating directory bookmarks found one area user must actually find track bookmark made makes sense sort defeats purpose audio bookmarks dynamic playlists playing belive creative calls feels awkward times menus simply take long get operate well anyway could go player didnt meet expectations ill say average music listener expecting much may satisfactory mp3 player someone cares thier music collection wants fluid responsive playback cant recommend product
time loaded hundreds cds onto computer idea carrying around music became attractive
older computer running windows 98 se something recent would find process even quicker
cause discs show together looking nomad
two tracks exactly name one disk copy gives option skipping second overwriting first second
even better ipod integrates perfectly itunes managing music snap
first zen lets sync one computer
second automatic sync creative lets review songs begins transfer
lastly ipod itunes play wma formatted songs
skip next track hated song comes ipod
none features available ipods 1way transfers cannot make changes ipod premanent
ipod beautiful thing look touch player controls less functional
apple get good product get way apple wants
got thing christmas happy ever since
excellent
tried belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter found much interference
gb 1000 mb hard drives ipods mp3 players 35 gb memory
aware
256 mb player roughly 60 songs amount dollars 30 gb 30000 mb player roughly 6650 songs sells slightly
lock computer require reboot
extremely convenient
rips tunes mp3s puts computer
pros cons great price
mp3 player lot memory want spend ton money think great purchase strongly recommend
cheaper every way
also unproven battery life
anyone says hey havent used product friend received one christmas instead ipod since envied vastly superior product
good player bad software
final verdict good player great price terrible software makes ripping transferring way difficult
simply configure mediasource software windows media player ripperdujour create file names include artist especially album names addition track names
one issue mediasource software despite pulling id3 tag data cdds service ripping process fails populate year field
weird
sound
complaints
ripping songs past weeks ease use wonderful
two things stop giving stars hohum software comes system traveling case comes
jumping ipod train take look marvel
includes 20 pay front get look player
shopped around buying harddrive mp3 player
first battery replacable user creative intended unlike apple ipod
new organizer software ships nomad zen xtra couldnt easier use
thought id buy set headphones use included earbuds work quite well
ships carrying case belt clip
player overall disappointment couple big flaws potential buyers wary readers need know third party software company resolves virtually creative mediasource file transfer issues
mediasource recognize tags
choices moment manually retag music rerip using mediasource
45 mins listening audible static player
unit defective
amazon reviewers say corrrupted music files didnt use long enough know clearly need use caution
words zen convenient data storage device buy capacity need music collection see point sizing information
stop playback pressing buttons first pause button next track previous track button
buying zen xtra check whether battery recharges via usb zen nx
exceedingly simple navigate around device
didnt read thing operate intuitive
cant imagine would spend hundreds dollars ipod
wasnt sure long would take would break
feel like quality construction wasnt sure long would last
player intuitive outputs great sound quality
many complained software included opinion easy use effective
dont pulled great price get pay theres reason model cheap
fully expect go bad way next months reviewers pointed construction pretty flimsy
10 time cant find device attach pc
couple weeks got state could never find device matter often rebooted pc reset device reloaded drivers etc etc
amazement even process errorprone
thats moot point
would given star review first weeks depending mad felt crummy software
way ipod im happy man
kind company
nomad explorer provide functionality offered 3rd party programs like notmad
chic look good build player comes compact form metal face plate
love audio sync allows oneclick synchronization player music collection computer
11 minimal pause songs less devices good achievement harddrive based player 12 big storage entire cd collection one small device 5717 songs 491 albums counting
music organization based id3 genre artist album etc
folders cannot created audio files
workaround update id3 tags files mediasource hassle many music files
lack good accessories oversight creatives marketing
creative thirdparty powered speakers work great thirdparty wireless transmitters
already mediasource installed due owning creative audigy soundcard need reinstall supplied cd older version connector zen
recommendations buy extended coverage offered retailer device moving parts essentially portable harddrive
favorite play track rediscovering music
dont like ipod lovers denial
bought 30gb zen xtra wellknown national electronics store soon saw advertising 21999 combination price storage size player features makes player best market
battery stays charged long time takes hours fully recharge via included ac adapter
connect player computer via usb open mediasource listen stored mp3s stream directly xtra
get mp3s hard drive save space enjoy massive music library
folder computer called mp3 slayer thrash metal stravinsky classical ice cube rap able play contents folder searching artists genres manually
zen xtra transfer files player folder name
ok paying x00 something used likely get better cost less future try determine device lesser evils
ipod used external disk apparently stores files without problem
however music data apparently separated ipod reviewers complain white noise random feedback mode comes appointments contacts created ipod synchronization
scroll wheel finicky works time learning curve pressing right new users say 50 75 success rate find frustrating return device
karma gets consistently good reviews sound quality connectivity docking device rca output jacks ethernet jacks connectivity
comments reliability warranty repairs accessories
noone mentions whether stop button photos dont show one
contacted customer service creative said product seems broken cannot help something effect
wow
bought player week like far
friend ipod years battery messed
ipod play couple hours fully recharging
entire music collection great travelling plane car trips dont decide bring copy onto player
try buy possible although mac addict decade everyone know previously bought ipod nomad zen xtra far better value easy use regards hardware software interface
mini ipods look best 4gb theres way would ever buy mp3 player measly 4gb storage
advice mp3 buyers consider much storage space need try listen buy mp3 players fully evaluated holding listening
dont care looks always drive size important
yes included earphones suck everyone replaces anyway
front cover pop easily always mine case didnt notice first day
cons short warranty months got extended warranty best buy occasional freeze easily fixed popping battery somewhat flimsy navigation wheel
excellent player especially price features comparable even excel ipod
price thats still less even lowest level ipod able get 40gb monster best part works great advertised
solidly built nice dense feel
find controls wellplaced flimsy least
screens large easily read
sound exceptional though cant really compare ipod
songs recognized automatically id3 tags first since organized files folder previous player iriver
dont buy player
therefore im saying im returning right see wat happens next zen xtra replacement
one fails hope let happen first 90 days later cuz thats warranty
every time nomad thinks file corrupt os freezes
way recover plug power cord go recovery mode
controls somewhat harder use oddities software tagging system people live
people carry around almost music collection
decide owner responsible damage even returned within warranty period creative charge fix
headphone jack seems major problem
even hasnt expired creative likely claim owner caused damage turn voids warranty
means nomad long enough load lot music get used
says harddisk problem
worked good
