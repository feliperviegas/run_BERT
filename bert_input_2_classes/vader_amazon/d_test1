play audio video scrolling black white
picture hopefully still remote control
press pn button located bottom right corner remote
done research experimenting remote apex ad2500 seemed lost video signal
im happier person discovering ip button
fastforward rewind work much smoothly consistently models ive
wish would movies thats one rare cool feature forgo
player works looks great get dvds play
apex doesnt answer phone
dad also apex tv another great value money
ive bought apex dvd players
back using nice machines consider quality pretty low
save money long run buy something decent instead buying cheap every month
apex 2600 steady performer
bought mine december 2003 real problems
problem vanished first month assume temporary dust issue
also didnt like way displayed information way screen zoom mode
one stopped working february march
problems
player usually plays dvds occasional problems recognizing dvd stopping particular point movie every time played able access certain special features rental dvd
went use sound picture
buy player
took months repeated followup get replaced
door broke month
sends discoutinous signals tv tv pictures one moment white noise moment
returned failing play dvds
purchased ad2600 feeling comfortable reviews read amazon
dvds trying fairly new great condition
would spin read spin show display disc
ended sending unit back amazon
customer service nonexistant
even used new dvd player already disapointed
trying week contact apex
low profile space saving design looks nice
find apex ad2600 great buy
less month later screen freezes eventually shows disc
surprised find could dvd player play mpeg2 format allowed stack movies dvd also able play vob files created smart ripper
plays backups everything else put without hick
price excellent buy
pleased apex ad2600it plays anything put drawer
read instructions well shouldnt problems dvd unit
one big difference 1201 2600 models 2600 model virtually silent
wont play movies
keeps coming disk errors
dont waste money
spend money well worth
say im also pretty impressed user interface playing jpeg mp3 mpeg files stored cdrs dvds
slim formfactor together mirrorlike front panel sure makes player look cool pricey
one bad thing though find remotecontrol bit flimsy predict probably die player
poor quality dvd player
second lasted two weeks video went
get paid
25 dvds ive played ithave problem watching movie picture freeze dvd still plays eventualy picture kicks back skipping moments
obviously composite video output different analog audio signals progressive scan mode
also registered unit online posted two messages apex support person cant possibly one
barely worked
also reason picture looks washed svideo lots color bleeding compared component connection much perceptible difference 27 tv

makes sense though substandard products make
good price bad product
34 way first disk played naturally 31 days purchase dvd player froze

ive pleased picture quality durability snow car boat wind
got best lens adapter g3better canons
although may think youre dealing amazon youre dealing second rate store youve never heard
called twice times said ship

thanks nothing amazon
major design flaw camera major design flaw
called canon technical service center see defective camera
however occasionally use view finder trying frame picture lens blocking view much
looked nikon coolpix 5700 canon g3 decided g3 due ergonomics much comfortable hold use price
far ive pleased
theres noticeable difference quality megapixel image versus megapixels s330 especially want crop enlarge pictures
hot shoe flash attachment allowed buy use sophisticated flash unit chose canon speedlite 420 made greatest difference quality photographs builtin flash cameras gives flat photos redeye annoying shadows good addon flash unit bounced ceiling wall pleasing almostnatural lighting
im starting think may one weaknesses digital photography level
120 gb remote drive use store digital images imagine theyd fill ibooks internal memory pretty quickly
bottom line youre serious digital photography bitten bug using digital pointandshoot may camera
added 224 ive camera two months im even pleased
especially useful portraits situations
battery life camera twice nikon 5000 better anything else ive seen
minor nits camera fairly boxy looking needs wrist strap instead neck strap bit slow shots
best 4mp compact digital available camera perfect enthusiastic amateur photographer
comes 16 mb compact flash one rechargable battery charging unit included fast small
manual mode feature rich cant wait get hang
camera comes lexar 16mb starter card stores 10 images fine mode highest resolution intend buy bigger card soon
use scene modes fine tune options change iso level shutter speed etc
two cameras similar functionality pricing
speed noticeably slower canon especially flashes
low battery twice wiped entire pictures memory chip
images taken indoor werent clear
got flash get eventhough room well lit
lens cap really annoying
else simpler viking cf cards takes couple seconds write picture approximately fine picture quality image size 1600 movie clips taken always noise cant avoid
would rate 45 stars picture quality image size defined specific nikon coolpix
good camera terms function quality take chance nikon absolutely sucks comes customer service
amazing camera amateur photographer piece advise folks thinking making move digital world
nikon 4300 feel best camera features price
requirements digital camera initially thought buying megapixel camera good 4x6 5x7 prints wanted really great 8x10 photos
say happy decision ever since
things might make even better pictures taken indoor setting little dull rarely hazy tend take photographs distance
takes camera actually capture photograph time click button seen people becoming little impatient waiting flash glow
whichever camera buy add upto 200 dollars additional memory card bought 256 mb card usb card reader camera bag warranty
finally get pictures developed kodak picture maker machine even though costs little extra one beat kodak processing terms clarity brightness
super camera compact 35mm broken vacation europe hand finally decided enter digital age
first intended buy 3100 really happy invest extra money 4300 lense lot better 4mb produce fantastic pictures
shows single sign visible rendering pixels could never tell picture taken digital
furher contains card reader flash card folder cards lense cleaning rag ac adapter helpful working outlet environment
currently olympus d550 takes wonderful outdoor pictures

instructions
imagine place bit knowledge take photos
memory card fit nicely since also pocket pc automatically installed picture software pda wolla
buy camera buget got one
go get

one downside though autofocus work well battery low
comes 16mb flash card need upgrade
really awesome camera hard beat generalto moderate snapping
work use field often hold really well
take excellent macro shots well
compact digital camera especially useful little children around always take camera take many pictures
try buy high capacity ultra card 2x faster regular cf card
finally settled nikon coolpix 4300 week camera exceeded expectations
heck took dark kitchen indirect light coming though door focusing fine
since wrote review january 2003 still love camera
provides added protection camera lens allows use filters
put manual
would also recommend buying extra battery least 128 mb compact flash type memory card
one rated high several people check site epinionscom
disappointed purchase
average indoor shots flash quite good 35mm
however convenience using digital far outweighs slightly less accurate indoor pictures
excellent little camera quite bit research buying camera one everything looking
im amazed photo quality prints 35mm prints
minor quibble since cameras market still include 8mb cards
perfect consumer digital camera research digital cameras youll quickly find camera best value
picture quality excellent
use lcd viewfinder see whole picture

slightly better average phone class
loud speaker function 6610 great dont need put phone right next ear talk
samsung sony phones offer lot features 6610 personally like samsung phones better found liking flip phones much

nice small excellent comes downloading games graphics ringtones
first night got phone put next went bed listen favorite music station handset doesnt weight anything light feel comfy
dont product without plan
thought ultimate phone comes basic features dissapointed saw gsm comaptible phone

downside though may big one
recomend hearing troubles like talk lot crowded public places annoying way
could make phone calls locations previously could like apartment
simply love feature
addition comes sleek powerful headset
maintain phonebook calendar todo list ms outlook lotus notes transfer data back forth
felt write comment asap quite excited using features
using bulky 3650 three weeks searched smaller alternative
requires significant force operate scary small phone
awesome phone great prices amazoncom

sound good complicated
saw another review saying gripe lack voice dialing
anyway thing really look fact phone voice dialing

earpiece button answers hangsup phone mess phone unless dialing number
resolution good colors bright even changeable
one downside writing tmobile hasnt updated tzone system fully support 6610 website show compatible phone try access game downloads tzones system returns error message saying phone supported
therefore wanted travel abroad pop local sim card even unlock phone way use local wap browser internet
spending hours transferred one tech help person another got fed decided return phone
phone good huge array features built
purchased phone last week using till didnt problem till
design sleek color screen good resolution
however main problem think sound quality
bangforthebuck
xtra improves upon zen nx larger nowblue backlit screen infinitely better
xtra doubles maximum filecount capacity 16000 mp3
decided get player research
looked ipod dell jukebox samsung napster player
thats important lot music
software great
doubts player well dont
ounces pretty light light ipod
far software pc works easily
would appreciated firewire plug however included leather pouch big plus actually protects unit well something lot carrying cases fail audio devices
shopped around month looking good mp3 player heard good ipod
creative labs zen xtra features ipod get amazon going pay 300 great player
music easy get menus easy understand despite alot ipod owners say know search artist name online zen
great player blows ipod away easy use understand features software simple understand use great sound matters mp3 player
within minutes able transfer files
several play options one best option shuffle based certain playlist
also costs lot less ipod
good deal music data storage
interfacing software unacceptably bad
interface software userfriendly anything easytouse
yet tried cdripping program
depressing scroll button selecting always responsive
great player
zennxs replaceable battery deciding factor purchase zennx ipod
zennx keep running price replacement battery like batterypowered appliance
thing looking pretty cool sexy ipod
want great deal great mp3 player get nomad
sold archos 20gb jukebox recorder satisfied slow loading amp difficult navigation mention froze quite bit
refused go ipod going spend money apple name trendy player
closest alternative best buy type
receiving zen xtra 40gb mp3 player say never go back archos
functional runs super smooth amp fast also eye candy
sound quality also nice hooked sony headphones instead factory earbuds comes
quite happy 10 gigs music stored baby well gigs media files data folder
complaints mp3 player
holds sooooo much music audio files
music demands pretty intense handles demands without problems
thank
think whole zen line fairly innovative reasonably priced really appropriate compare pricing zen line ipods although ipod still way priced
went transer issue returned zen xtra purchased 40 gig ipod
transfered 16 gigs 15 minutes without errors via firewire
software great long adminstrative user account windows xp
took 30 minutes download everything 950 songs
start sending files itll continue done hits song title another song point skip skip replace replace cancel
two transfer batches first english songs foreign languages didnt come errors aside duplicate name mentioned
theres dent upperbackright lowerbackright corners obvious unless youre close
far sweet
ill borrow cds rip friends even come close filling thing
people also complained case window thats really big deal either case sturdy offers good protection
thing im concerned quality longevity buttons thing
use mine office car cassette adapter taking flight back east holiday
got im diggin
nightmare
dont tags itll lump tracks directory cannot searched via artist album zen recognize folders
long since ive program shut windows hardly even noticed happened
thats probably bad thing
always finished process something didnt cause file errors
little jog dial seems weak quirky hope dont figure way break
though im happy new mp3 player
highly recommended
creative product playback quality unbeatable
actually using nomad jukebox easy uncomplicated
finding particular song album nomad jukebox fast easy
highly recommend product ease use hardware software playback quality value price
reviews ive seen seem indicate creative mp3 jukeboxes best sound quality 2nd generation jukeboxed ipod archos dell samsung
ive tried belkin fm transmitter unit amp worked well set top portable radio awful trying use car somewhat disappointment
dislikes controls much inferior simple ipod ones
black fly wheel feels pretty cheap amp uncomfortable use
tried play song three times success
working 10 hours shuffle totally rocks
want rename cd title already transferred become frustrated quite quickly
ridiculous
seems always difficult press make selection
little cumbersome scroll many levels get selection want
case ever make quality control
despite things listed far could live item since saves lugging cd case work gym car etc however main reason satisfied product fact lock odd times
players software easy use good
keep short cheaper opinion better choice ipod
another electronics fan
fm transmitter place unit car listen unit car stereo
going need player rugged may one
would recommend upgrade sure best chance trouble free operation
familiar mp3 encoding encode cds varying quality levels
youre someone wants put 10000 songs thing may want encode lower end typically 128 considered close cd quality
price price compared ipod great
one word caution regards using nomad itunes
using something called ac3 least trial song purchased format compatible format nomad
software classify songs genres
nice feature ie
early morning rather listen easy listening rather heavy metal problem
software comes plenty defaults genres
also create dont like classifications
wow dennis sure great
anyway im gon na go find dennis nice day
support asked navigate folders beside artist album answer yes
sure customer rep know product exactly still new give anser users would like hear
managed make creative nomad explorer work
though 3rd party software excellent
like way apple innovative lets face cant one idea enclose 25 hd within aluminum case stylish package long especially buzz little techie pod
bought zen xtra 30g gift
software failed repeatedly
couldnt load one song software crashed
creative tech support operators work 96 pm weekdays time work hours spend time
dont buy thing
otherwise player awesome
volume range great blast want
perfect purchase
naturally quite bit review purchasing recomend wwwnomadnessnet pricewise zens unbeatable
took minutes mastered controls
uploading music quick easy
unit well structured buttons need none dont
screen large defined easy read silver unit naturally cool
ipod users send back pay 100 replacement
impressive flaws
eventually gave customer support worked fixing problem
software working fine mp3 player fantastic
awesome
signal noise ratio ratio detectable useful data unusable garbage say radio wave larger stn ratio better nice high 98 decibles noted apple refuses release stn ratio ipods
ignored instruction booklet product figured organize separate playlists within minutes
less computersaavy might find apples software bit friendlier though use friends house lot
pretty good
seen price ipod extras need
reason get stars spare battery would great
games cool screen use
transfer windows explorer windows recognizes jukebox additional hard disk allows simply drag drop files windows explorer folder nomad
almost made worth price alone
took maybe 15 minutes transfer 1000 songs
whe transfer songs jukebox dumps single folder sorts id3 tags
fm receiver none
portable player feel bit durable
songs dont play one another like cd
add playing list
plug nomad directly stereo use car adapter dont get quality true line jack
sliding old fashioned volume knob would also easier digital version included
difficult navigation wont necessarily say difficult dont enjoy scrollwheel navigate
stands case pretty useless unless youre packing player travel load songs beforehand
overall feel decent buy happy
able simply import files rather go multiple steps find
instructions come dont explain make things simple
buy instead ipod
found interface nomad easy use basic knowledge computer
also ipod games
allinall another excellent creative product
small light nice looking display decent well
many people written software one downfall personally havent single problem software im running windows
cd ripping mp3 easy even rip cd directly mp3 player wont take space pc hard drive
controls player simple need manual
playlists made fly without aid computer use play modes like shuffle repeat playing selections playlists
made mistake thinking could easily manage mp3 library device
throw cell phone youre asking trouble
wanted use nomad cassette style car adapter
sound quality cd player superior setting nomad
great product
well surely product recommend someone getting rather mp3 player size price
word amazing got christmas
going get 10gb ipod looking 10 day warranty ipod battery lasts 18 months costs like 200 dollars replace mail get battery replaced like 99 big improvement lol fact lots people problems ipods windows computers realized much better buy
transfer files computer mp3 player help media sniffer read manual
easy
big backlight makes things easy see writing big enough people see
sound quality amazing
expecting worse really good especially files good sound quality
earbuds suck
case doesnt close maybe mine faulty case isnt great
far player froze started pushing buttons loaded since hard drive based expect
hope helped
storage capacity great large huge cd collection loaded everything want listen still 13 gigabytes free
controls somewhat harder use ipod gotten use even beginning think would justify huge difference price
meant take cds fairly short period time done year work
cd classified number genres multidisk sets get separate classifications different disks artist performance
tagging problems result think nomads operating system
also happen recording jazz set number outtakes song without numbering separately
minor problems list save anyone else trouble discovering
hurry load cds would spotted sooner
also already loaded tagged cds home computer would issue
player controls heres ipod drives nuts
player controls easy hit accidentally
also lets remove songs play order
win software little cranky much easier customize needs
planning getting ipod changed mind last minute mostly whole battery issue dont patience sorta things
cuzin got ipod wont say awful product say price apple could better far storage battery life goes
overall great unit amp hopefully creative labs vendor soon come accessories
purchased mp3 player last night scouting around
thats things keychain size
consider youre going use device
youre jogger want strap arm id recommend flash memory
even skip step rip directly cd player
ipod costs amount memory
xp prepared dont alarmed
beast
comes tank case cut piece screen always keep case still access everything
yet another inferior knockoff
pros price capacity slicklooking design improved interface removable battery cons protective case completely useless since obscures display window
cut window using swiss army knife
scroll button cumbersome earlier models
eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality mp3 files
investigating multitude player options asked received 60 gb zen xtra christmas
since zen xtra use folder structure duplicate name problem stems actual file name songs title artist album
solution
cd collection pocket
memory hold amazing amount songs entire collection cds fit great little tiny piece digital fun
great longer wonder music want take cross country flight two week trip take everything
moreover want total 107 repair
offer 3month warranty players including zen xtra
im screwed
dont
buy creative mp3 player sure get optional extended warranty
purchased retail store got extended warranty
also delete songs player create playlists fly player
would better sort window teh carrying case could see display without opening
havent figured yet
documented zen manual neither hard copy cd version
discover read 10 online reviews many complaints lack stop button found one reviewer smart enough figure amp document
m3u files used mp3 players like musicmatch winamp creative without notmad need manually recreate playlists doesnt care software use rip catalog music creative company 125 gb music transferred zen correct tags hooray
top fit well unit
felt defective cover came didnt fit well flywheel use navigation wasnt tightly uneven far amount pressure make engage
great product great price
flimsy product
gap allowed front panel fly barely touched
price performance looked right
bought late last year enough reviews knew navigation wheel software would less ideal sounded like fair tradeoff
didnt im used electronic products 12 month warranty
ive thing month headphone jack already come loose
ive got call customer service course 800 number send thing back
like reviewers installation hell
finally uninstalled reinstalled software usual measure last resort sort thing
gut tells ill also end buying ipod
even star seems like im giving creative benefit doubt
never buy creative product
excellent battery life 14 hours beats ipods
creative mediasource although sleek looking windows mediaplayer effective organizing collection linked good cddb service gracenotes
cddb downloads information cd insert type track information album artist song title etc
cons player plug play need install nomad explorer first mediasource transfer files patient used winxp detecting player dragging dropping music files
problem collection ripped cds updated id3 tags downloaded music
people problems flip switch bottom releases player cover issue immaterial use case case covers switch
buy good pair headphones unless already one
set speakers wireless transmitter accessories add players usability latter allow play car radio home receiver etc
handle player care meant dropped
also love waking music attached speakers
headphone jack
called creative said send would decide warranty
dropped couch landed carpet cover battery flew
headphones suck would invest cool ones since eax feature
software sucks
usb 20 transfer insanely fast
read reviews main contenders market ipod creative zen rio karma iriver ihp youll notice pros cons none perfect decide whether want take take plunge later
products drawbacks mature yet expect value reliability wait
ipod clearly buzz
everyone complains nonreplaceable battery yet price sturdy construction
creative zen feedback suffers construction quality poor product support difficulty using scroll wheel reasonably consistent feedback problems headphone jack
usability button usage feature selection menu structure display size quality also good feedback
repair seems issue say repair dont exist buy new player
like zen karma support folders designed data storage device
karma stop button
arent many reviews iriver ihp
pay money learn experience youll informed buyer buy device arent paying x00 learn experiment cons outweigh pros wait year
lasted 12 weeks
dont get wrong thing like heaven week
pro removable cheap battery li battery usually works properly 13 years
well say bad history players
28 30 software takes space
eax modify sound different presets pretty good get different variations
also search song good
dont know people saying software awesome
easily access ur files easily fill id3 tags take big collection music lazy without problem
read today also online fill id3 problem
clock date get helpful
product manufacturer promised 14 hours recieved 68
like eax hours eax 85 hours panel seems like come easily people said
need software actually transfer files player minor glitches like example turn 60 percent time sais shutting means turn turn likings
also priced affordably
40gb storage 7500 songs player everything music file room 2500
sound settings adjusted personal preference
possibly biggest advantage player price wasnt enough fact user replace battery opening lid popping new battery
since batteries run everything also big moneysaver since ipods irivers rca dell builtin batteries need replaced technician apple charges 100 bones battery replacement
ipods white plastic look surface doesnt suit
also liked fact save custom playlist made player computer
interface practically seamless
