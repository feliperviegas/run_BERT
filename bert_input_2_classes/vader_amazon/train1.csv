0,1,simply doesnt shine
1,0,id like start saying product using archos jukebox recorder made product great open source os called rockbox based hardware one could assume archos players horrible hardware standards fine men women took time create upstanding rockbox software archos became top notch player intuitive features wazoo come zen xtra first ill start saying players hardware pretty good sound indeed excellent form factore bad still rather larger expected really made mediocre mp3 player software
0,1,transfer software hellishly horrible experience also players software
0,1,first many actions player utilizes dont make sense bookmarks example excellent feature player rather creating directory bookmarks found one area user must actually find track bookmark made makes sense sort defeats purpose audio bookmarks dynamic playlists playing belive creative calls feels awkward times menus simply take long get operate well anyway could go player didnt meet expectations ill say average music listener expecting much may satisfactory mp3 player someone cares thier music collection wants fluid responsive playback cant recommend product
1,0,excellent product minor problems
1,0,became interested getting mp3 player got new work computer office bars addition nonwork software doesnt care load cds onto hard drive

0,1,example jimi hendrixs cd live fillmore east one cd classifed classic rock psychidelic rock
0,1,perhaps weirdest one bruce springsteens cds tracks set classified goth rock
1,0,change need paying attention information downloaded copy
0,1,somewhat troublesome problem internet site sometimes give different discs set slightly different names
0,1,cause discs show together looking nomad
0,1,change harder spot minor variation title dont title disk front
0,1,two tracks exactly name one disk copy gives option skipping second overwriting first second
0,1,rarely problem kind popular music troublesome classical music tracks identified tempi
0,1,also cant understand software ignore lists cds alphabetical order
0,1,finally making playlists computer complicated tracks listed individually organized cd listed organized alphabetical order
0,1,words locate track using software computer add playlist must know name cd appears find track locating location unlisted cd looking tracks appear
1,0,dont problem make playlist nomad cds listed separately
0,1,need computer however want add tracks playlist
1,0,bottom line happy product

0,1,couple things didnt like though nothing serious little larger mp3s still light software takes time get used maybe 1015 mins thing would definitely destroyed one fall
1,0,ive seen em archos dell ipods everything good price great sound makes one best opinion
1,0,granted cheaper ipod
1,0,cheaper every way
0,1,far heavier much larger might seem matter except use running keep pocket
0,1,far difficult select songs easy use fly playlist creation new ipod mention doesnt sinc contact lists phone numbers address books ect
1,0,like ipod eliminated need kind palm device
0,1,also unproven battery life
0,1,everyone says cant buy ipod excessive use short time man made ipod battery life video admitted used extensively every day charged fully every night 18 months conditions rechargeable battery dies
0,1,alternative ipod one viable ones alternative would anyone seek alternative something really needs alternative choice theres nothing wrong everything right
0,1,id like see well small company supports mp3 player years battery dies rechargeable
0,1,finally software used put songs vastly inferior itunes two levels first poorly integrated overall player clunky use especially tagging second wma audio format sucks flat sucks terms sound quality compared vastly superior aac format apple ipod uses sticks one sub par paid music services napster instead allowing use itunes store ever plan pay music far best
1,0,anyone says hey havent used product friend received one christmas instead ipod since envied vastly superior product

0,1,difficult change genre album track information large number tracks
0,1,youll changing track information lot cd database information utilized software mediocre best
0,1,multidisc box sets youll notice artists name album name genre often change every disc
0,1,final verdict good player great price terrible software makes ripping transferring way difficult
1,0,excellent way carry music collection
1,0,despite slightly larger ipod must say surprised see small unwrapped box
1,0,ripping cd collection 160 kbps wma files gives average around 6065 mb per cd good 900 cds 57000 mb free memory available
