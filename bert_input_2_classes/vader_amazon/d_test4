first player allow access menus dvds
hit menu told playback

problem dvds would repeatedly freeze playback counter player kept going
one also exhibited extremely slow speed going menu
problems consistent also present another dvd player
great first three hours
hooked everything seemed going fine
upon inspection find small scratch surface figured cause
received apex ad2600 expected
read consumer reports apex reliable brand experience reading reviews think little homework considering another apex product
2600 false silver plate instead play display
plays original dvds cds plays mp3s jpegs
play dvdr unplayable older philips machine
build quality feels solid doesnt shake whine playing discs picture sound top notch dts dd51 sound good
really easy directions setup fiddling around picture zoom etc
however dont know dvds performance heavy load everyday viewing
fired away picture turned quite nicely
using kingston 512mb cf works great fast
nothing perfect
word awesome would describe camera
g3 loaded many useful features unlike many smaller digital cameras easy hold steady using slower shutter speeds
lens visible viewfinder lens set wide angle since use lcd time really much bother
negatives quite bulky size minolta vectis s1 aps slr uses heavy battery although solid contructed mostly plastic unlike canons elph line ergonomical youll find even pointandshoot lens viewfinder borderuer lcd scoying
unless want print murals dont need
considering olympus camedia c5050 convinced buy g3 visiting store holding hands trying
olympus bit clumsylooking userinterface friendly canon one features sold g3 battery life camera gives type battery life canon g3
showed turn lens zoom lever loves
tried brands stores disappointed battery life company plus see lcd optical finder isnt get even color output less expected
hand anyone know take great photos
love option manually control fstop shutter speed even focus
manual mode easy use fast access selection shutter speed aperture without fumble menu options
work love
would recomend purchase lexar media cf camera sandisk card comes packaged small slow
outstanding camera first digital camera pleased
know whole lot photography happy know camera always perform even grow skill knowledge
four megapixels great
drawback viewfinder slightly blocked lens
give 10 stars
well flash photos never great still lot noise
one time use camera may well
versatile seems one best
watching development digicams years waiting make first move
two limitations knew would deal long lag time focuslocks even bright light unsatisfactory light quality builtin flash
youve got exposure within acceptable range g3 shown produce utterly stunning images hardly get nikon f100 film camera
one complaint g3 software comes processing raw images shoot raw image mode first thing replace 32 mbyte cf 512 mbyte cf gives 130 raw images opposed
believe enabled second file comes camera stores information
without tweaking exposure accurate colors realistic ive ever seen produced film raw image
least youre starting photorealistic images ive ever seen camera
perfect camera photo hobbiest wants easy point shoot ability well
manual functionality excellent downloading pictures quick breeze quality astounding
save time wont regret
objections naysayers almost caused purchase different camera end figured id give g3 try
service supplier exceptional
cares
always shoot using lcd panel
great gains g2 ability selectively switch raw format record review gives incredible postprocessing flexibility
battery life 45 hours compared 25 hours g2 hours nikons
shape device little squarer without losing weight means better balance less shaking clicking
g2s color effect exposure mode removed replacement selectable effect func menu option available exposure modes
course buy tool shelves separately helps comes camera
dim lit environs g2 could easily outperform camera thankfully g3 maintains rep personally believe even outperforms g2 terms less haze astonishingly real colors
short eos range canon d100s nikon slrs
agree positive reviews
camera performs like believe
last digital camera ill buy ive looking buy digital camera long time finally decided time
worried seeing friend change batteries olympus 2030 pictures
gorgeous read reviews specs performance opinions
perfectly happy g2 trade g3
silver magnesium finish stunning sharp lines excellent grip better camera ive seen
compared olympus c5050z sony dcsf 717 nikon 5700 based cameras features dozen online reviews one seemed like best round deal
comes clearly written manual learning curve steep
already bought camera suggest buy hiti dyesub photo printer
crop enlarge best practically extra cost time
technology finally folks make photo life easier
camera none flaws something youll use time
short new slr expensive lens several film point shoots
excellent idea
hands someone doesnt yield good results idiot program auto mode
made plastic
lot opinions relevant switching film
beats sony f717 archrival
19in flat monitor 1200x1024 resol
story based personal usage
pictures fabulous short learning curve tons features havent even gotten
address two previous somewhat negative reviews yes lens barrel obstruct part lower left corner lens viewfinder however lcd viewfinder rather stunning find rarely using lens viewfinder
beware see cant rank product since merchant amazon collaborating camera
lie
finally gave deadline said could meet
although accepted ship mon jan still didnt ship
said stock busy
everything else camera great
love longer ive using powershot s330 nearly year wanted upgrade megapixel camera longer zoom adjustability hot shoe external flash remote control
larger lens g3 gives better picture quality low light 4times optical zooms gets much closer
g3 different type battery charging system smaller canon cameras battery needs charged camera charging system also enables use camera plugged without running battery
yet try using adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc controls well thought manual relatively clear
use camera right box automatic setting slowly get comfortable manual settings
ive bothered blownout highlights s330 g3 seems slightly better
bought 512 mb card seems hold 400 photos highest resolution
youre investing camera level buy software
said review s330 digital cameras easier use apple computers
make sure buy tripod separate flash unit time youll see difference photos immediately
comfortable camera easy use best digital photos youre going get price
best nonslr digital camera megapixels ive using g3 six weeks proven advertised
pointandshoot camera intend get finer features id suggest less enthusiast featured choice
recommend camera
bought camera fit budget preproduction production model reviews positive
auto mode functions basically point click scene modes easy use produce good results
macro mode exceptional pictures clear take pictures lens unbelievably close subject
nikon although picture qualities good mp cameras ive following headaches pictures wont transfer pc directly camera using included transfer cable
cons reviewers clearly pointed good things camera agree
camera keeps autofocussing auto mode buzzing sound cant stopped
go get high speed like lexar 12x higher cf card
bad service within year problems menu dial knob
labor
also lens cap design flawed
want small camera seems get lost hands wasnt comfortable
course wanted respected brand stay within budget bought expensive camcorder hadnt used much
experimented online print ordering two major us brick mortar retailers delivered great results
highly recommend accessory kit provides everything else need nice camera bag holds camera plus cables charger
however average person unsteady hands doubt itll perform well lower light settings
inside pics bit challenging instantly delete pics dont like focused perfectly need lighting adjustments make camera simple effective
use 128mb card usually get around 70 100 pics 10241280 res good resolution
battery life good although recommend two rechargebles alkaline backup emergency pics
extremely pleased camera
find emailing pics everyone know
ricksters review much research decided nikon coolpix 4300 many great features bad ones
im extremely glad bought camera
got christmas still learning settings dont take pictures every single day
buy 256mb compact flash holds lot pics resolution
stars please little camera created marriage nikon
100 perfect put thought time reading manual take photos
took camera gave someone
128mb card shoot 150 hi res photos
easy enough use beginner like plenty features grow
battery life ok plan buying second battery larger cf
disappointed great camera price cant beat
found controls intuitive learned manuver menus quickly
field tested use older versions 880 885 model office find produce excellent quality photos
drawbacks noticed comes rechargable battery seem last long especially use flash lot
manual set single af focus depressing shudder button prior taking pic really hinderance familiar menus features
reality drawbacks camera much less many models
recently bought coolpix 4300 along 256mb ultra flash card
extra rechargeable enel battery also handy seldom run battery situation
one thing puzzles fine 2200 quality pictures one ultra 256mb cf card hold 130140 pics size pictures around 12 mb math add
would expecct card hold 200 pictures size 12 mbper
drawbacks ive encountered indoor shots distance 8ft lack contrast color ive found problem cameras builtin flashes ive used even nikon slr
ill still use photosuite editing
one thing indoor shots many reviews knocked camera low light focusing
summary love camera would wholeheartedly recommend anyone wanting high quality point shoot camera medium price range
downside might accidentally take pictures lens cap camera wont fit small cases 28mm filters expensive hard find
yet figured make snap quick pictures action shots
autofocus feels exactly like film camera scene manual mode add little fun challenge
buy camera savour
extremely satisfied camera
regular mode camera works 80 settings
easy use sheer fun able use array nikon accessories like telephoto wideangle lenses proverbial icing cake
yes picture quality features numerous mention unmatched camera price range
cool seriously
love
better actually cause carpet looks clean lol
windows upgrade xp anyway lol
love continuous shot mode allows take 16 pix rapid succession great action shots
8mb camera like joke
card memory must
compact controls well designed theyre still easy use
battery removed recharge
excellent phone excellent service

distortion problems phone pleased phone ive used
extremely light dissapears pocket
6610 great phone extras person needs phone demand
well aware many features phone known one yet mentioned using phone modem computer usb 10 port
problem found internet service access mls real estate broker software well
well aspects internet browsing
also want family plan mean need tw phones plan arent free two rebates

find lack entertaining games phone quite disturbing
nokia seems campaign revamp phone keypad imho totally unnecessary
get phone cingular atampt go carriers
great phone great service voice dialing
first saw 6610 thought small
tad small hold ear shoulder solved comfortable handsfree earpiece included
unfortunately 6610 offer voice dialing like previous phone features packs outweighs shortcoming
also set background wallpaper

service deafults showing information associated billing zip code change default seach areas go

rate plans also good least
phone would received stars phone voice dialing game downloads tzones worked
phone highly recommended otherwise
find another phone buy one form
would definately recommend phone
like predecessor quickly revised nx player boasts decent size weight navigational system categorizes based id3 tags excellent sound widely known better ipod surprising considering number years creative audio peripheral business
especially useful listen mostly pop music store short ditties
compared ipod zen xtra falls short bit
sort music artist title album genre play music based categories
players interface also easy use
ive week dont regret purchase one bit never leave home without
sound thing
suppose could jog seems made enjoyment music
worth
screen may little smaller readable doesnt come overused blue
apple
batteries last longer
marked increadably high compared models almost 500 30gb theres nothing made worth much money
theyre pretty comfortable stay place deliver decent audio quality
main problem nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb software
nomad explorer software songs draganddrop
although soundquality good takes good sound portablemp player result good product
want accessories ipod offer maybe thats go great investment someone like enjoys music hates carrying multiple cds
rechargeable batteries lose holding power time around years
choosing zennx nobrainer factoring cost new 400 ipod every years versus 50 cost replacing zennxs rechargeable battery
terrific mp3 player great price
dont lug around 80 cds dont know im going want listen biking home
software easy use within 30 minutes opening box listening one 80 cds
free didnt know still carrying case really protective accessory need except good headphones
flat
stayed night trying figure thing
easily drag drop files nomad explorer easily alter id tags sort music according liking artist song title genre etc
lots sound options equalizer almost like winamp options
also navigating playing music plus unlike previous player
plugged doesnt lag computer like archos unless massive transfer data one load
playing little device dont know would look ipod space costs 500 got mine little half price
really complaints unit
fact boyfriend going invest one suckers well realizes best choice current archos ipod eyeing
come 300 could least put good pair earphones
sheesh
battery nice
listened several days needing recharge
lcd screen large readable
zens use standard notebook drive
puts zen line players like rca jukebox whole line archos players newer ones bit better original archos jukeboxes popped drive 20 gig jukebox recorder put 60 gig drive use exclusively powered portable usb 20 drive
guess thats often see ipodders bashing every player often knowing anything whole spent 120 something better feel better thing
fiddling around notice dissapointments transfering could get songs completely transfer via usb 11 20 would transfer 30 songs come error
scroll button scroll wheel nice idea keep less clutter button would sometimes get stuck keep scrolling
casing scratches little easy glove cases work great protect
itunes versatile program havent issues ipod
say freeze hasnt done since
love player would probably go creative labs
anyway player great deal really love
good product
sort songs adjust titles accordingly maybe applies players nomad dont know
counting time spent editing songs suppose shouldve done anyway pc transfer pretty painless
wasnt pretty
easy enough pop open see song youre listening
sure little bigger ipod much
unit use go jogging anyway
ipod neat piece machinery screwing around think zen products way go
requested received zen xtra christmas gift
put little work renaming duplicate file names get music zen xtra wasnt big problem
music hasnt problems
screen large bright info need need
always internet logged internet use feature download album amp song id information free service click button
ripping songs creating playlists couldnt easier
use midpriced headphones rather enclosed earbuds
played back symphony orchestra would swear seated dead center front orchestra good
like play music album nomad jukebox plays songs order actual cd
time decided turn player much surprise comes quite little library classical music one childhood favorite bachs air
charged battery
ive got 1200 songs 4000 go
love
poor reliability
bought break within month
must differing preferences others prefer supplied earbuds sonys thought sounded good players
love storage thing
100 cds transferred havent made dent 30 gb drive
lock transfer music
left set desk came back five minutes later wanted keep playing song
could stop could get playing screen
remove battery
occurrences locking bore details
also times unit turned period time upon powering starts playing screen song cd playing days
havent quite figured one yet probably operator error
second creative labs mp3 player definitely fine product
thats pretty much negatives positive things truly outnumber negatives negatives arent bad
first players sound quality superior ipod
purchase product definitely rip songs windows media player
features would nice fm receiver models
details dont drop unit ive player month
decide encode 320 fit less device someone encodes 128kps
done song song basis mass
sometimes get really lonely like put kenny light candles doesnt help capitalist pig like buying things nah mean
problems figuring turn unit creative good job clearly labled button found left cellar first time years
ok got zen xtra little bit week ago
transfer files easy using notmad however would great nomad supported folders like iriver rca lyra
dont let bad reviews software change mind
visceral teases include case sound quality capacity
havent checked resilience xtra yet dont plan
creative thinking
purchased player say love
one question add tracks nomad via nomad explorer automatically put alphebetical order rather album order
would like album order live albums wondering
wow thing trash
want laundry list reasons
dont waste time engery resources thing spend little far functional ipod
dont buy
disappointment
software downloads site crashed pc
inconveniences one songs automatically play one another like cd
replacable battery great since eventually wears lithium batteries able buy another easily
also nomads 14 hours battery life versus handy
equipment included average isnt big deal since thats buying
conclusion player ideal purchase
would recogmend player anyone know dissapointed
nomad jukebox zen xtra good mp3 player software gets hurt
im pleased zx heres quick review
sound excellent one would suspect creative product
environmental audio however almost completely useless made songs sound worse without encode songs 192256 kbps without variable bit rates
transferes song seconds
sound good loud works well portable speakers
intrested recharger works anywhere world quite small
pros excellent sound found music reproduced faithfully jukebox
found much easier method transferring music nomad using software
install software computer youre transferring instead connecting usb connection
would much easier
able easily copy 2gb worth video files computer transfer friends
usb 20 makes fast transfers
took 10 seconds transfer 200mb file
cheap construction made player hard plastic put rubber corners
player take jogging
cant simply bring entire list songs click play hit next
add songs play list
like people dont want read instructions want use
would recommend replacing existing software notmad explorer simpler use found internet
wasnt easy fast forward pause song regular walkman
included earbuds uncomfortable
left right would given better control
case nomad comes leather holding case
way could keep case time
cut case bit xacto knife make useable though
willing overlook problems get superior sound quality low price although feel player lot room improvement
price size features cant beat price
ended suing windows player make mp3s actually wma files using probram transfer
buy storage price avoid know nothing computers
reason ipod better user interface
problem whatsoever product
software installed flawlessly without problems windows 2k machine
would recommend product anyone
player fast sounds great also many options like slowing speeding music making sound like youre hearing music huge auditorium
initially loaded 3700 tracks intent ripping majority remaining cds mp3
heres dont need nomad office
mp3s stored workstation
bottom line get making playlists avoid rearend collisions ill buy regular portable cdmp3 player burn collections 120 tracks per disk
well decided get one
hasnt gone second notch charge mine whenever im home using battery life seems fine far
little weighty ounces biggie otherwise fine
buttons easy use easy navigate
customize bass etc
buy new ones asap
remote would cool lets push
forgot case doesnt fit
simply doesnt shine
ease use impressive put price 130 paid amazon player
also need send ipod replace batteries die
listing process accurate track names unlike windows reliance amg frequently gets track listings order results odd
example jimi hendrixs cd live fillmore east one cd classifed classic rock psychidelic rock
rarely problem kind popular music troublesome classical music tracks identified tempi
words locate track using software computer add playlist must know name cd appears find track locating location unlisted cd looking tracks appear
dont problem make playlist nomad cds listed separately
bottom line happy product
apples ipod dominant wonder whether price differential mean years market share drop significantly
poor substitute ipod
simply friendly functional ipod
got 40gb ipod replace zen 20gb model
software lot people complain creative software actually find creative mediasource organizer strengths itunes
ipod one way machine computer player
zen outstanding way shuttle music sources cant ipod except cumbersome workaround using ipod hard drive instead player
lot prepared convert mp3
ipod also let see whats coming next player
zen allows scroll song list selected player
bring album absolutely hate tracks zen allow delete playing order
think ipod versus zen typifies differences apple win machines
mentioned reviews headphones useless need replaced right away
flash card memory expensive light compact
tiny
averaging 45 mb per song give idea many songs get amount memory
said pretty sturdy machines wouldnt let dissuade getting mp3 lot memory
want listen tunes travel id get hard drive put much thing including audio books
review zen xtra 40 gb device larger ipod similar capacity
comes good case fits snuggly
scroll button sort annoying push nice button would nicer eh big deal
also stores data see placing data files
im really happy purchase
also installed software said windows xp hadnt approved something drivers etc continuing install may cause instability
youre like definitely make pause
heres stuff know starting good things screen really big blue light back perfect fast hell music transfer controls easy use mastering scroll button great sound ive heard many mp3 players ton different equilizer type deals
couple things didnt like though nothing serious little larger mp3s still light software takes time get used maybe 1015 mins thing would definitely destroyed one fall
granted cheaper ipod
finally software used put songs vastly inferior itunes two levels first poorly integrated overall player clunky use especially tagging second wma audio format sucks flat sucks terms sound quality compared vastly superior aac format apple ipod uses sticks one sub par paid music services napster instead allowing use itunes store ever plan pay music far best
multidisc box sets youll notice artists name album name genre often change every disc
despite slightly larger ipod must say surprised see small unwrapped box
file transfers fast nearly song per second via usb 20 several people complained difficulty transferring multiple songs title
possible
even happened identical track titles disc could still edit file name manually get onto player
eax features pretty cool well creative included number eq adjustments example compensate extraneous noise encountered car train
plusses easy remove battery terrific sound produced nomad
powerful piece equipment
ripping songs even 11 usb connection still quick quality good
got rma creative sent player repairs
better yet buy another company stands behind products 12month warranty
really shame otherwise creative mp3 players good best sound quality players market
despite hype ipods knew wanted something different wanted storage ipod could afford would offer wanted flexibility purchased music online
point media sniffer music files let rest
sound great volume satisfactory commutes shutting external noise
flaws creative mediasource software ok rip catalog amp burn music starting scratch used musicmatch rip cds bought zen 278 cds 3400 tracks 125 gb music ripped 128bps guess
turned eax back static also present
creative sound people computers cant understand eax would introduce static
eax faulty
full moon night
zen stop button
zen nx battery requires ac adapter recharge charge usb cable tragic usb recharging would convenient additional choice
referred microsoft jet database engine error install program suggested download service pack ms website fix problem reinstalled software error
probably bad luck part personal notebook install error
however motivate find workaround solution
associated company providing url search notmad find pretty easily
hoping static heard using eax blip summarize using creative zen mobile device using musicmatch rip amp catalog choose download music using notmad explorer move music amp playlists zen amp computer
creative software using device driver
get without
stored around 60 cds 160kbps barely touched available memory
cruising around device within 20 minutes
pcside software goofy takes little getting used bad reviewers indicated
whereas folks ipod nomad jukebox zen xtra confused nomad jukebox zen nx
bought one returned defective good reason
quick summation found
got weird messages okd microsoft something like thought failed load loaded
top covered battery kept poping without much touch near bottom latch
navigation easy found syncing files player computer vice versa easy
construction player cheesiest ever seen front panel refused clip correctly leaving noticeable gap panel base player
cant comment quality audio back store ripped single cd
like many reviewers really wanted like product
300 device skimped headphone jack
reviews ive read sounds like wont end troubles
subsequent behavior even worse
creatives online support help
fact id rate among worst ive ever encountered
gut tells nomad long run best 40gb portable hard drive albeit one cant create folders worst expensive lesson companies never buy products audigy sound card find many ways equally frustrating
forewarned
bad company
within months stopped supporting new mac os
great value amp great sound carry entire collection
sennheiser 497 headphones volume loud enough 12 max 20
player user interface ui intuitive use allows easy navigation large small collection
nomad explorer winxp style interface works well transfer files back forth use nomad external although tech support website states primary intended purpose player player
cheap userreplaceable battery 50 creative great advantage ipods battery costs 100 replace
use primarily provided protective case although dropped feet desk accident well played outdoors 30 fahrenheit weather design continued work fine
fast mediasource cd ripping takes 40 seconds cd pentium pc 24 ghz 1gb ram 52x drive

use files id3 tags problem cds ripped within last year
resources pros summary great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wakeup sleep timers multiple play modes cons summary plug amp play relies id3 fm recording bottomline cant beat carrying 500cd collection wherever go
kind product goes within month
kinda heavy kinda like walkman
overrides songs go put titles especially remixes
awesome feature
would recommend using id3v2 tags stick id3v1
hard disk mp3 players
view life going pay x00 get device must near ideal ruggedly constructed fault proof good product support easy use software favor dont buy yet
seems like youre
ipod stop button new users mention ipod veterans call unnecessary 20th century
added functionality battery replacement detracts build quality face plate prone popping
many reviewers say faceplate simply didnt fit well returned zen
enough people reported headphone jack doesnt work month using device believe creative inbuilt manufacturing quality control problem
zen doesnt support folders really storage device even third party software creates folders documents programs cant launched zen hard disk storage device best
seems like movement even small movement causes skipping playback even device freezing
perhaps smaller user base also lack accessories
like
otherwise feedback seems good
accept better devices new generations ones year two cost less
heres something know considering buying one
size style appearance okayed least ugly
easy use lot reviews mentioned con software mediasource cannot work pc
tons reveiws reported problem
fact creative mp3 players software problem first place
ps mediasource provides similar functions ms mediaplay like cd ripping tagging music database managing music file transfering use ms mediaplayer musicmatch free downladed explorer computer grab files disk player replace mediasource
short player good size value hardware design really bad software
one broke one got stolen bought riovolt sp 350 planning buy player
player complete piece sh
returned sent back crap
cons display awesome see everything want read clearly huge storage space loaded entire collection music isnt much 400 songs still 26 gb 28 provided
sound awesome put loud depends yoursound quality sound might crack
use software correctly put id3 tags get awesome database collection easily access songs
turn player player turns really fast music continues play left turning
