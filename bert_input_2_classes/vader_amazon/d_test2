dvd door would scratch top disc every time closed
attractive features small size layout remote

unfortunately player would read region one dvds
probably one dvd players 40 play almost everything throw
also light portable
bought apex ad2600 ability play jpegs seemed like bang buck
difficulty playing jpegs even trouble properly playing dvd movies

software engineer keen technical details everything buy spend around months buying digital camera must say g3 worth every single cent spent
whether novice expert ease use functionality goes together
lens visible optical viewfinder
overall im happy toy
following research decided g3
absolutely awe camera canon put enormous quality g3
still little suprised canon correct design flaw releasing camera
despite minor disappointment highly recommend canon g3 anyone serious digital photography
photo quality amazing know im going fun features
ive figured features already used digital cameras know things like symbols
4mp right target market camera semiserious amateur photographer 4x zoom nice great thing digital general generally see results exposure settings lcd screen take picture two weeks later get film developed
lcd screen pulls rotates direction easy pictures
even take picture looking lcd
highest optical zoom pictures perfect
canon computer software used download sort upload manage digital pictures computer nice easy use
dont get fooled megapixel marketing hype
used 35mm cameras find g3 comfortable friendly use
gives great pictures controls easy use battery lasts forever one single charge software userfriendly beautiful chrome casing
absolutely breathtaking
camera canons great colorimetry plus see lcd get
canon g3 gives tons control photo buffs still auto mode makes easy novice use
didnt think would find quality ease use 1500 im thrilled purchase
noise level camera significantly noise iso 100 nikon 4500
pictures brillient bought camera days ago
great gadget bought last week amazon
love camera
still trying figure may options
generally overpriced little bit get paying
sure features tried shoot girls basketball game want task
500 save could print results life camera
took outdoor photos plenty light objects werent moving photos awesome
camera marvel
get focus lock wait restless subject pet child strikes amusing pose fire shutter reasonable probability getting subject still focus
second problem solved direct lighting metz attendant shadows unfortunately
didnt wait experiment
instead bought adobe photoshop camera raw plugin
g3 raw image software gives fantasy world designed please uncritical
girlfriend loved using camera much point shoot pry hands time
whoa
camera arrived time perfect condition
legitimate criticsm online reviews fact lens really obstruct viewfinder
perhaps inspired canons factory whitecorrection settings found lacking altered user white edges buildings etc could cleaned g3 much sharper white offsets
overall g3 delivers must considered best image quality current megapixel digicams detail tonal balance color response point view
needless say canon hands
ability charge every night dont know long would actually gone dying
camera stay years
lot research decided g3
ive able change modes thing without even looking manual
standard battery include g3 camcorder battery allow take pictures day without worrying charging
said last digital camera ill buy market one advice buy best thing afford keep forever
info digital cameras go dpreviews
boxy
g2 slightly curvy champagne finish homely
little digital elphs bestdesigned mostelegant cameras g3 came along squashed
good choice price range first digital camera
seemed like really good compromise
would nice compromise jpeg raw
save picture raw display seems like waste battery power
seems focus metering complete quite lag shutter
using mac os twain utility download pics directly photoshop
spent much time included software dont know say seems ok quite happy camera
image quality color function say almost everything
first foremost take better pics film cameras
duplicates brainer cheap
wife shuns new technology compained brought home shes forever asking digital camera
excellent camera spent lot time comparing different cameras realized thing best digital camera
always spend money get better one
however seems general rule digital cameras
big plus shifting digital g3s large mobile screen helps
negative points included memory card small
used brass cameras dropped picking camera like g3 unnerving experience
light easily go small handbags pockets
learning use take long
unless making posters g3 good enough
extensive research chosing g3 theres nothing like picking one playing first
also one electronic items works right box
ive havent heard diagnos fix
also got 512mb viking compact flash enough 255 shots full 4mp resolution max picture quality used 250 3lb subnotebook usb connection tons hard drive space long trips verify ive taken subnotebook also saves buy extra compactflash
suggestion get lens protector help protect shooting lens lens coating wear many clean wipes im getting 52 mm adapter uv lens filter
canon g3 review response recommendation cameras work art science thats understood
takes great pictures operates quickly feels solid
actually several differences g2 g3 differences continuous shooting optical lens control layout playback zoom image processing
bring us consumers better choices never sent product
look viewfinder lcd bottom left corner picture 15 blocked lens
strictly use lcd view finder highly recommend camera
ive camera two weeks shot hundreds pictures far
needed three batteries keep going s330 battery g3 real powerhouse shot 300 photos goddaughters birthday party without switching backup battery
onoff button feels somewhat flimsy awkward tiny little lockout button needs depressed turn camera
worried megapixel photos would download slowly theres difference working files
time purchased camera also bought adobes photoshop elments 20 software cant praise highly enough
handson comparison nikon coolpix 5700 sony dscf 717 lack quality feel features g3 ultimately chose g3 outstanding image quality resolution coloration superior
beats competition almost every area including battery life enthusiast features external flash capabilities available storage types image formats
allinall believe arguably best nonslr digital camera market
best far canon g3 improves almost ways g1 g2 fact beats nikon coolpix 5000 performance picture quality battery life amazing 5000 megapixel camera canon megapixel camera
canons optics better believe processing algorithms also better
fine resolution setting maximum close adds 1000 images gig card
manual fine job filling blanks remain
perfect grow got camera three days back although experience digital cameras prior purchasing one still rate beginner
needed something power bought nikon coolpix 4300 fell love camera combines ease use immense amount options power
would really good given option stop autofocussing want date time image software nikon view reads images date time images metadata
use card reader copy images got onceagain open software put date time
overall good camera really good picture clarity exceptional closeup shooting capability
worse claim kind internal damage refuse cover cost via warranty
made camera totally inoperable
manually take cap order use
nikon got final nod settings auto manual along movie modes medium compact size price brand name good software included previous reviews
think problems digital cameras major complaints
looking forward vegas trip great photographs
movie mode also working great
4300 comes excellent easy install software use xp win98 without problem battery charger usb video cable
64mb flash card camera comes 16mb holds 52 pictures normal resolution
store clerk concluded blurriness may caused shaking camera slightly press button understandable since camera lighter two models
im sure camera wonderful features others talk
large pics take 8mb
nikon coolpix 4300 wonderful easy use high quality compact size
never knew could love digital camera much
software comes amazing online service comes free really neat
clean clear well focused 95 photos taken beginner
friends impressed quality pictures took
ive using months
quality superb
small size perfect little hands may perhaps uncomfortable awkward bigger person
got 256mb card hardpressed fill weekend
3x optical zoom average cameras
digital zoom top optical zoom sacrifice quality
set camera manual mode one main reason mode autofocuses continuously burns batteries
easy focus drawbacks dont think hate camera
dont get better compared lot cameras believe value money
picturers amazing
dont get better nikon 4300
consider time save picture taking especially missing good moment download well worth little extra money
sorry highly recommend camera anyone looking good digital camera takes great pictures yet doesnt take weeks figure operate
uploading images windowsbased pc fast simple
battery life seems short side adequate situations
picture editing software came adequate robust
dont use bracket hold head aim flash left hand
leave adapter uv filter time
also allows turn camera without remove lens cap
great camera great camera
impressed easy camera use
manual easy understand mostly idiot proof
small unlike canon slr easily fits pocket
great camera reviewed several digital cameras settling one
picture quality outdoor settings 35mm
scene mode works well remainder shots going regular setting
however 3x optical setting acceptable 70 shots take
camera great
ooh dropped still works fine little camera many features havent even gotten yet
optional lenses like wide angles extra zooms
digital film uses compact flash cards easy find cheap reliable supported many devices may hoome
nikon coolpix line wellestablished line know support parts going available even nikon releases newer model
battery life excellent
10 great price features
usb though
two different adapters ure ure required attachment lenses
annoyances though comparable youll find cameras price range
automode good enough shots 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes well manual mode though admit havent played much manual
several years torture hands atampt customer service delighted drop look forward august 2004 convert familyphones atampt tmobile

negative impossibly tiny difficult operate barely visible power button
great speakerphone great reception
rare occasion bring tmobile store located many countries europe

speakerphone loud clear nice extra features like currency converter stopwatch
cons ring tones come crazy songs annoying rings one ring sounds close regular ring
games kind stink cant download get link cable get additional games

said phone extremely well way better anything motorola produce
oh anyone comments yes know motorola announced quad band edge bluetooth phone shipping time writing triband gsm850 phones lack gsm900 band important like globally roam

id like see old carrier
tmobile ruins otherwise good phone
complicated features menus easily accessible quality features great
one things tmobile brags fact worldphone used europe etc

bottom line youre attracted phone triband feature take abroad forget
talking voice clear
yes ipod looks tune carefully articulated urbanhipster persona thats become popular late sureashell isnt worth 200 premium unless dying match music player volkswagen beetle urban outfitters wardrobe
chose one read best deal money
transfering easy software makes everythig pretty easy
even battery life great advertises 14 hours actually little less still good
hope new yet without remote hard
pros software easy use although redhat software better costs money much cheaper ipod good looking player beautiful blue backlit screen youve read player complained lack viewing hole face case good face doesnt get damaged scratched fast transfer rate issues yet cons youre going need buy new headphones stock ones suck hopefully player sell ridculously overhyped ipod
otherwise smart save cash
zen xtra sounds great good headphone well recored mp3s
ipod killer thing kicks mighty apple butt
thing lasted well 14 hours played straight first time
zen nx 100 cheaper ipod size wonder much apples markup anyway
could little bit bigger easy get used
plusses changable battery loads presets environments decent construction still quite small light despite slightly bigger ipod
overall small sounds great less expensive apples overpriced ipod
messing store noticed bad ipod
ive weeks best player ive seen used ever
get new headphones set
great product windows computer
intuitive program
controls easy use
ipod buy cable isnt compatible windows pcs
earbuds come arent bad
relatively new computer p4 windows xp usb 20 os complained installation drivers
player sorts problems
player hangs file transfer every onceinawhile prompting reset
one beef scroll doesnt work well id like
thing great enjoy
replaceable battery lets zennx keep running running
zennx hopefully gain market share prompt arrogant apple lower prices enable consumers replace battery
lithium ion rechargeable batteries good 300500 rechargings battery lifespan vary according usage
still apple continues squeeze dollars consumers designing battery replaceable
love new nomad great
best electronic ive bought since born
early christmas gift got zen xtra 40 gb player
buttons amp neccessary lil gadgets sides player nice holding palm hand
navigation smooth finding files cinch
oh screen saver feature pretty sweet another plus book file limits
transport files friends house ease
able install
youre talking totally different hardware
20 gig ipod still goes 400 thats huge difference especially price range
size bigger ipod software music match jukebox isnt greatest search funtion isnt fast even accessing hotkey shortcut
song transfers issue
chose keep ipod happy purchase
great
opinions personally dont understand complaints interface find pretty easy use unlike remote interface audigy nx pc actually gives option clear previous playlist want play another list
meaning dont manually clear list load new list
cons arent really big deal except one con annoy way stores files folder structure based title songs many songs seperated folders pc titles change titles make sure didnt might another
man work put chinese songs player actual chinese names songs title since current language selection english even though think menu supports chinese track info saw
would ask want overwrite another song number
buyer beware
wouldve still bought drive even knew issue beforehand
im sure people problems either interface nomad software comes unit
sound quality excellent im fussy stuff unit looks cool screen bright easy read replaceable battery means major advantage ipod besides price everyone knows
put shuffle sit back enjoy eclectic mix almost 3000 tunes offer
ive already emailed creative tech support gotten timely responses fix necessary well see need
rip tunes 192kb like alhthough 128kb sounds dandy youll get tunes stored
bottom line great product unbeatable price
got mine 160 less ipod 30gb got extra 30 applying amazon visa thanks amazon
basic shipping bit slow thats okay
shame mine going back
excellent product
received 40gb zen xtra yesterday im extremely pleased
setup transfer process cake
unit lock times hit reset button fairly painless process well
havent tried setting playlists yet cant comment problems
high resolution screen easy read backlight
locations various buttons one side somewhat illogical included creative software pretty poor
red chairs notmad explorer great amp recommended every reviewer repleace creative jukebox software
would either play song skip wildly matter unit resting desk
installed software
arent hooked cddb get album info guess manually input stuff little work save looking songs
good player technology yet great
problems setting software getting favorite cds transferred
warranty 90 days
buy resellers extended warranty save headache problems later hard drive die issues time probably sooner later
cutouts controls thought much material way adequately access controls especially scroll wheel
aftermarket cases available model yet live
also lock shut attend phone call
quite simply firmware os control thing ready prime time
store definitely get extended warranty another day purchase date obtain one
excellent product
compared musicmatch software better filing system easier use
would given pros price gb storage storage capacity user replaceable battery cons fragile broke 1st one within 10 days scroll button switch case hides display open see
mentioned broke player within 1st 10 days
dont think ever use full 30gb
currently 1100 songs encoded mostly 196 kpbs havent even used 10gb storage yet
higher number better quality less data compression used larger file size
end world better design sure would nice
software ive problems software
found intuitive use didnt read documentation using successfully within minutes
26 mhz pentium usb 20 able perform task pretty quickly would estimate minutes per cd
addition create play lists create equivalent compilation cd right player
sound level also high would expected
probably good health ears however consistently play near high end volume range hearing fine
first choice
price features really good
even navigate genre artist album since genre get tracks genre division
notmad worked right away install would like see product
often fill need better organization library enought variables
zens rule
get pretty lonely
nomad ugly big comfortably fits pocket heavy controls hard get used
got get ipod
feel cheap plastic feels like would break easily definately wouldnt survive drop screen hard read cover hides already annoying poorly lit display scroll bar travesty enough said software another great misfortune hard operate crashes frequently screwed music library doesnt work mp4s list goes case small took like half hour get monstrosity fit cage doesnt look pretty spending kind cash want something asthetics bit course im taking mine back tomorrow morning getting nice shiny new ipod instead
received item christmas met exceeded standards
uploaded 3000 songs minimal difficulty
lots interesting features included eax customization
problem using player feel good player
main computer software work right
sit phone customer support hours help
first theres unit
small overall bigger ipod keep mind different less expensive necessarily inferior technology used zx
lastly price fantastic spent 269 30gb zx compared 299 10gb ipod also expensive iriver ihp120
problems since seem couple bitter reviews maybe maybe sad ipod owners since recomend instead
transferred zens new software onto 10 seconds
looks cool seems quite small light
pleased far
files already pc wma format 200 cds
far good problems conversions
great long music id3 tags youve downloaded songs internet many probably dont
im sure would survive fall feet
could crush thing half two fingers wanted
probably easier way havent found yet
use ripping cds pretty good job
otherwise difficult figure awkward
line jack said none
headphone jack acts pseudo line jack
sounds decent would estimate get maybe 80 quality would true line jack
want instant access volume hold button wait half second player register
crappy headphones
think biggest flaw
hold scroll wheel long common lot songs sort get stuck rapidly going songs wont stop several seconds let finger
would much nicer window could see screen button didnt cover ac jack
good money software awful
looking multiple large mp3 players decided get one
buttons interface easy use
quick sync isnt good becuase either needs configured properly isnt useful
mp3 player get much memory much less ipod
games ok cell phone mp3s music
thing roxxorz
money need 40 gb player
doesnt get better
asking zen xtra specifically christmas researched many different mp3 players finally decided one couldnt happier im convinced best one
purchased returned product glaring flaws design
dont need nomad home reason although using sync two pcs might reason enough get
hazard car
navigation nice enough scrolling searching thousands tracks hundreds albums artists even dozens genres conducive save driving
creating playlists using included software minimize issue wasnt easy would liked
sure old school carry cd wallet around easier manage ill save around 250 bucks
one major complaint significant complaint sound quality
eax sound enhancement feature didnt enough custom eq limited band eq
give enough control
unable achieve sound quality par simple portable cd player bass boost
excited ipod day went best buy check mp3 players came across one
well say product good mean might little big still fits pocket
complaint would need id3 tags amp takes mp3 files dont
player silver
people complain scroll wheel big deal though little annoying times
also slow song amp speed cool
250 dollar player could thrown nice headphones
excellent product minor problems
became interested getting mp3 player got new work computer office bars addition nonwork software doesnt care load cds onto hard drive
slightly heavier ipod longer battery life
loading cds somewhat timeconsuming think would ipod well
music home computer transfer would accomplished quickly
load disc go internet cite insertion names cd tracks
somewhat troublesome problem internet site sometimes give different discs set slightly different names
change harder spot minor variation title dont title disk front
finally making playlists computer complicated tracks listed individually organized cd listed organized alphabetical order
ipods form factor much nicer heres zen better
happen push wrong button wipe order songs put
lastly cannot manage anything ipod
ability serve backup music collection huge plus
excellent alternative
explains see appears weird pricing mp3 players
didnt bother much still decent size
front cover remove take battery feels flimsy snapped device still feels pretty solid
thought software decent enough wasnt complicated learn
drawback
ive seen em archos dell ipods everything good price great sound makes one best opinion
far heavier much larger might seem matter except use running keep pocket
id like see well small company supports mp3 player years battery dies rechargeable
doesnt always register pushbutton movement
difficult change genre album track information large number tracks
youll changing track information lot cd database information utilized software mediocre best
ripping cd collection 160 kbps wma files gives average around 6065 mb per cd good 900 cds 57000 mb free memory available
ears 160 kbps wma file sounds good source cd zen xtra sounds good portable cd player
buy extended warranty youll need
might find review useful nonetheless
took twice long get unit said
creative also sells batteries via website theres shipping player waiting sent back new battery
could comfortable complaints sound department
ive played around equalizer settings satisfied range choices
however dont like carry belt clip isnt secure case slip
also carrying case came mine covers display even though side controls reachable open see display
zen minimal stoppage tracks listening music continues one track next gap hesitation slightly audible click listening progress one track next dont even notice click
dont think
despite reviewers giving kudos zen music quality experienced flaw using eax
mediasource application serious user interface flaws
underestimate purchase decision
many reviewers refer clunky difficult heed warnings
provides drag amp drop transfers music computer amp zen time transfers music zen asks want generate playlist allows playlists developed software transferred zen
notmad features advertisement please see companys web site information conclusion knew know would paid extra get ipod amp avoided zen
one items first glance looked cool didnt really ring bell
one recommendation creative get marketing people work names things
memory 40 gb staggering
problem using musicmatch software already computer load songs albums onto unit screen good easy read sound quality good going take tweakings settings try make great
good youre taking traveling
decided save opted zen xtra disappointed
love player extremely happy decision
recently bought nomad jukebox zen xtra didnt even get far charging battery
im willing accept shoddy construction something paid 250 dollars
casing player bad cant image hardware good quality
boy wrong
reading reviews looks though people really love device month two come hate
know better
lets talk software
buy notmad software week ago found vast improvement
player works well sony srsa 202 powered speakers
usb 20 means fast data transfers song sec
dont always care gracenotes genre listings allows easy editing id3 tags
10 multiple play modes tracks order album shuffle etc standard jukebox players worth noting zen xtra deficient matter
dock unnecessary charger usb cable necessary
case occludes display screen closed
got 40gb jukebox zen xtra christmas
ive month headphone jack went
itll take 1015 business days decide form get
nothing hassle company
replacement battery 50 compared ipods 150 cons thing dont like cover suck
best jukebox mp3 player handsdown
minor complaints even though music sorted via id3 tag player option search music contained folder unavailable
unfilled id3 tags cause music potentially placed folder called unknown
great design looks cool
geeky nonapple type reviewers complain scrollwheel annoying resent forced applelike interface
synchronizing music among computers one seems issue research buying multiple computers want synchronized
reviews sound quality generally universally positive
reviews apples support generally poor seem address issues warranty covers short time delivery pickup item
zen detachable face plate allows battery replaced
creative software awkward difficult use plain doesnt load computers
zen stop button
rio karma feedback suffers sensitivity hard disk
complaint seems disk rotation slow leading longer delays functions playback even slow display menu
good little sure thing definitely costeffective ipod
low price comes lower quality
catch built like piece crap
want quality mp3 player splurge ipod
size small little bit bigger ipod
however creative lab come new update fix software problems
crossing finger wish fix problem
great player excellent sound quality hovewer flaws
others said far player awesome player flaws
songs mostly 320 kbps
10 player firmware remove glitches
hard drive freeze certain points well thats people said earlier previews headfone jack gets messed stil havent happened hope doesnt
copy delete files would timeconsuming rendered nonissue 40gb storage
personally crazy looks either ipod nomad
great player
player since xmass love
pros cons detail look design system terrific size design imo looking better ipods
scroll wheel better ipods well dont risk giving cramp running thumb around circles endlessly small nudge finger youre
theres socalled background hiss ive noticed least far
may complain theres draganddrop capability realize mainly portable music player computer accessory hard drive
software design geared towards enhancing music experience
overall im giving stars ive seen nothing problems people repeatedly cried havoc ive player leave room doubt headphone jack hissing scroll wheel problems show
far however im happy customer
cant rated zero stars
nearly 4000 songs went smoke
man cool
