0,1,prospective buyers would warn following purchase better pair headphones soon possible earbuds sound terrible terribly uncomfortable applies earbuds general make sure mp3s id3 tags loaded playlist automatically sort
1,0,want great sound quality dont want spend arm leg pergigabyte dont mind something iconoclast among many ipod users willing sacrifice cubic centimeters personal space large discount would suggest zen xtra
1,0,pretty good
0,1,read instuctions plug zen computer installed software onto computer rebooted
1,0,problems since seem couple bitter reviews maybe maybe sad ipod owners since recomend instead
0,1,seen price ipod extras need

0,1,however doesnt register instantly hard drive like players
1,0,nomad hold type file mp3 use portable hard disk

1,0,almost made worth price alone
1,0,huge storage space even 320kbs store ton songs thing
1,0,30gb enough people
1,0,took maybe 15 minutes transfer 1000 songs
0,1,cons navigation system zen xtra uses id3 tags embedded mp3 files organize songs
1,0,great long music id3 tags youve downloaded songs internet many probably dont
0,1,would much easier use windows explorer style navigation system
0,1,cant simply open folder player play songs

0,1,sounds decent would estimate get maybe 80 quality would true line jack
0,1,controls bit awkward
0,1,controls definately took getting used
0,1,first kept finding look nomad figure skip button
0,1,sliding old fashioned volume knob would also easier digital version included
0,1,want instant access volume hold button wait half second player register
0,1,crappy headphones
0,1,would replace better sounding comfortable phones
0,1,difficult navigation wont necessarily say difficult dont enjoy scrollwheel navigate
0,1,bit cumbersome cant get songs want quickly

1,0,people want buy ipod say ipod dont bother much better buy
1,0,hope helped
1,0,id like start saying product using archos jukebox recorder made product great open source os called rockbox based hardware one could assume archos players horrible hardware standards fine men women took time create upstanding rockbox software archos became top notch player intuitive features wazoo come zen xtra first ill start saying players hardware pretty good sound indeed excellent form factore bad still rather larger expected really made mediocre mp3 player software
0,1,transfer software hellishly horrible experience also players software
0,1,first many actions player utilizes dont make sense bookmarks example excellent feature player rather creating directory bookmarks found one area user must actually find track bookmark made makes sense sort defeats purpose audio bookmarks dynamic playlists playing belive creative calls feels awkward times menus simply take long get operate well anyway could go player didnt meet expectations ill say average music listener expecting much may satisfactory mp3 player someone cares thier music collection wants fluid responsive playback cant recommend product
1,0,excellent product minor problems
1,0,became interested getting mp3 player got new work computer office bars addition nonwork software doesnt care load cds onto hard drive
1,0,time loaded hundreds cds onto computer idea carrying around music became attractive
1,0,many people recommended ipod borrowed one friend
1,0,nomad jukebox three weeks happy
1,0,slightly heavier ipod longer battery life
1,0,storage capacity great large huge cd collection loaded everything want listen still 13 gigabytes free

0,1,loading cds somewhat timeconsuming think would ipod well
0,1,office would let put software work computer
0,1,meant take cds fairly short period time done year work
1,0,music home computer transfer would accomplished quickly
1,0,older computer running windows 98 se something recent would find process even quicker
0,1,reservations product concern tagging process way interacts software
1,0,load disc go internet cite insertion names cd tracks
1,0,cd classified number genres multidisk sets get separate classifications different disks artist performance
0,1,perhaps weirdest one bruce springsteens cds tracks set classified goth rock
1,0,change need paying attention information downloaded copy
0,1,somewhat troublesome problem internet site sometimes give different discs set slightly different names
0,1,cause discs show together looking nomad
0,1,change harder spot minor variation title dont title disk front
0,1,tagging problems result think nomads operating system
0,1,two tracks exactly name one disk copy gives option skipping second overwriting first second
0,1,also happen recording jazz set number outtakes song without numbering separately
0,1,also cant understand software ignore lists cds alphabetical order
0,1,finally making playlists computer complicated tracks listed individually organized cd listed organized alphabetical order
0,1,need computer however want add tracks playlist
0,1,minor problems list save anyone else trouble discovering
0,1,hurry load cds would spotted sooner
0,1,also already loaded tagged cds home computer would issue
1,0,even better ipod integrates perfectly itunes managing music snap
1,0,zen versus ipod
1,0,ipods form factor much nicer heres zen better
