handbag camera
messing around images photoshop supplied software package printing good printer yielded excellent results
please note first digital camera owned used
yes corner lens barrel distortion dont like harm done since always use camea lcd screen see exactly im going get viewfinder dont zoom zoom lens distortion goes away canon knows engineered way minimize parallax phenomenon lmost exactly ot picture
taking digital pictures notice people including errors compactflash results certain shots partially taken lost issue seems effect compactflash digicam brand

winner
thats hopes helps
werent busy enough charge credit card though
although tried contacting amazon see anything replies got inept hadnt taken time read complaint
im sending mine back waiting problem corrected
take pictures camera held head way beside problem allowing position camera best shot without contorting
also purchased good sturdy tripod combination new camera tripod remote control enabled take remarkable indoor naturallight portraits never would attempted
wound buying gray card use time custom whitebalance setting
helps avoid problem color cast pictures especially mixedlight settings
canon allows change lenses accepts ibm microdrive type ii compact flash gigabyte storage
small enough fit easily coat pocket purse
autofocus performs well love 12 optional scene modes dummyproof correspond many situations would actually seek use camera
bought 256 mb cf second battery good go long vacation
camera ideal people want power dont want spend 1000s dollars camera
excited bought coolpix 4300 two months bought canon powershot s400
easy sharing one teen age kid
ive problem canon whatsoever
careful battery low make sure carry extra batteries
certain issues might minor major ones though
became stucked makes almost impossible switch modes
send camera nikon servicing took whole weeks diagnose problem
audio video also lacking
wanted decent sized camera contour fingers hold steadily
depending requirements narrowed search nikon 4300 canon powershot s400 models
pictures come hazy hands shake even moment entire process taking picture
possibilities auto manual helpful scene mode offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc endless
battery life ok somewhat short working lot monitor
however indoor pictures subjects feet away blurry grainy
focusing display rack 20 feet away brightly lit room day time pictures produced camera blurry shade orange
anyway ended purchasing lumix
digital zoom takes good pictures optical zoom
love features presets well
sunset feature takes incredible pics morning evening
great camera great investment
auto setting great job time manual settings want
takes excellent pics easy use read manual
isnt big offensive though wouldnt know looking pics takes
wish could get high quality tiff images resolutions doesnt seem buget cameras
end one decided upon since never buyers remorse
point shoot photos great
great camera great camera using several months got excellent results simple friendly usage many scenes indoor outdoor snow close macro etc
particularly like way aids taking macro shots
assume case cameras since enough power autofocus
autofocus assist light nice taking shots lowlight situations allows camera focus low light
sacrifice weight size optical zoom requires glass focal length
menus features easy manipulate access takes silent movies
dont waste time looking anything else buy one
expected happily found qualities picture excellent 3m4m pixel fine combos many userfriendly functions similar slr models added convenience digital camera see pictures immediately
particularly like txt file records control information pictures take
shutter lag par ive experienced point shoot 35mm aps film cameras next frame advance couple seconds using high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card salesperson recommended high speed card since next frame advance speed important dollars
bought digislave dsf1s flash unit

nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six
dont buy camera going purchase 128 megabyte card

one thing say numbskulls complain cameras controls confusing hard remember read directions

much said reviews features phone great phone mine worked without problems right box
owned motorola panasonic nokia phones last years generally prefer nokia phone combines many best nokia features feature missing voice recognition
good phone soso service
oh goodness excellent hearing volume level phone especially quiet
also tzones although cheap 499 mo
however calls constantly drop area experince megastatic point id dial numbers 67 times get clear line
two days later phone returned complete working order
highly recommend nokia 6610
opinion nokia best menus promps hands
whether youre taking brisk jog waiting bus lunch park youll glad fm radio
treat battery well lasted
frequent signal searches eat battery power
volume level phone good
dont use vibration often easier hear vibrate feel
vibration even listed feature purchased
big minus
nokia cover phones bought amazon
menu flaws
upgraded 6610 local tmobile store
spent half hour phone tech support online tech person pull one shelf tell problem
tilt phone around catch light
reccomend
title says two biggest things excellent working speakerphone unlike nokia 3650 superb reception nokia known gsm phones make con think camera big deal size phone winner
anything phone perfectly
feet away still work perfectly
means good chance phone break easily like typical american phones
able use service another country decide go another country extended period time buy sim card service provider country
would phone number country pay international roaming country
size weight put phone pocket forget unbelievably small oh light
phone minor inconveniences lacks features bluetooth high spend internet problems things expected phone
love pros cons reviews ya go pros size extremely small convenient fit pocket bother
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones nice check cons also doubles radio nice feature bored
surfing web nice well wish wap pages available
able carry close body places phones easily concealed
keys close together layout bit funky relation standard rectangular layout keypads weird
features user interface find little inconvenient
menu options appear one time taking whole screen one scroll one one memorized menu order select using number keypad
vibrate setting loud
like speakphone function lot
pleased quality durability
much survey present handsets recommendations friends bought nokia 6610 really best phone one could
volume key hard press think may design rather flaw perhaps keep pressing accidentally call
nokia subsidizes free pc software
first big nokia fan upgrading cell phones year right release contract
evaulate phone tmobile phones borrowed parents friends sound quality important thing sound quality
think sound quality phone slightly better samsung phone motorolla t720 series sony ericsson t610 series
nice feature
sony ericsson phone t610 whistles bells also hardest use
6610 radio function utterly useless
music tones department 6610 20 chords thats number different instruments play think samsung think 15 donno phones feel t610 best sounding ring tones
free get new account anyway stick tmobile going use phone overseas tmobile actually allows unlock simm cards buy simm cards cheap nations plug phone international travelling
best phone seen
phones awesome
much pc suite ie
free ringtones midi files free graphics picture computer know program jme even make apps games
excellent gsm
think good mobile phone may buy
really great little phone got nice features beatiful screen great ergonomics tiny
waited years phones mostly like think didnt really need one
incredibly pleased
bought phone first came summer
say least horribly dissatisified service sprint tmobile fantastically refreshing
past two phones flip phones beginning tire
first calls loud clear unlike sprint
phone small light attractive
nokia 6610 sound quality phone great cool features amp38 options comparing older motorola phone gets failing grade speaker quality
ultimate phone mobile life
handsfree speakerphone quite powerful like motorola phone used
hazzles keying data using small phone keypad
builtin camera offer days kids stuff
live without integrated camera wont miss much
although find convenient use 1touch dialing phone voice dialing
couldnt happier tmobile either switched cingular
getting sick old motorola l7089 waiting right phone come along
great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone say probably favorite function downloadable java apps
quad bands start appearing upgrading
ton research settled phone small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan access corporate email
overall excellent phone
winning combination
probably best bet looking phone price range like patience deal annoying flip phones
would give phone world
included earpiece comfortable easy use
ive compared phone others 6100 siemens sl55
even though might smaller many people seem alot problems
currrently service tmobile verizon tmobile
matter seconds access email fax entire web truck
also leave review would like thank reading
phone voice dialing according amazon amp tmobile nokia
sister series phone loves radio headset
color screen makes phone shine bright commands responsive
gripe hardware buttons
finally reiterate thumbsdown rating tmobile carrier
nokia 6610 relatively new phone great phone
like default blue
get weather movies horoscopes clicks
tmobile service cannot say enough good things people answer phones
nokia makes great phone thats clear
one huge disappointment phones manufactured tmobile lack many menus functions nokia straight manufacturer
yet theyve gotten rid languages phone including italian german dutch
good phone
good samsung phones used earlier
quick update new zen nx
ill save cash another purchase
get player
another reason got put wma files
takes half space mp3s
sound music important
navigation bit tricky takes getting used included pdf instructions cover operation pretty well
personally dont like apple business practices screwing resellers customers employees left right shopped around something else
two main requirements longer battery life lower price found
sound excellent tip get real pair headphones
wont appreciate quality thing offer unless using good set cans
controls side instead front like thats thumb hold thing
scroll wheel big improvement ipod touchpad
screen easy read blue light bright enough read night dim enough doesnt blind stare long
menus easy navigate
complaint push scroll wheel select push straight sticks
faceplate pops battery pops open every 10 minutes
havent time really push player limit audio aspects nomad satisfactory expected creative labs
setup process nomad infuriating interface player subpar
notmad red chair software explorerbased program enables simple draganddrop transfer music files pc zennx
zennxs capacity price ratio 30g model 10gig trumps ipods 30g model 14gig
might problem price 30 gig ipod get 60gb nomad ipod simply pales comparison
want sexy cool mp3 player means get ipod hundred dollars one price holds 13 music
easy set problems archos
leather case comes pretty nice similar pda style case hold protect perfectly
impossible
2000 files playlist moment random nice job mixing
cd many problems win xp
also instruction manual bad
fantastic piece machinery
great buy
compared everything else category definately best bang buck
ipod competition
gave zen stars excellent class really appropriate rate based players different class
personal favorite karma currently karma zen usb 20 philips hdd100 upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder
ipod also attractable piece lightweight small
sound quality two zen sound adjustments normal eax features
granted little zen well worth
wonderful
love player
even though songs different names chinese number
dont know previous review couldnt 30 songs talking
00 transfer files upgrade without problem
bought 30gb xtra couple weeks ago far excellent
still 19gb left already 200 cds
besides user error surprise surprise hard imagine people trouble either
ripping amp transferring tunes basic pretty fast even 11 usb
course good customization options unit well sound presets navigating options playlists etc
fast forward button works takes little extra pressure make go
still fits palm hand heavy
get better headphones
awful awful awful
bummer great sound quality
brother bought ipod past summer dad bought original zen around time spent couple weeks rv together
explorer program shut couple times renaming titles changing genres didnt reboot computer anything open explorer
eax mode keeps volume level song come handy take holiday plane rides
ill admit id ipod money burn money much better buy
fantasic product
purchased nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb fantastic
sound quality jazz pop music equally superior
bought one amp ive enjoyed date
note add 30 price purchase worth likes great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod price best class sound large easy readable screen
installed software manually instead click past windows please register us spam inbox
well maybe particular song corrupt tried upload four attempts one unit locked required reboot managed upload album albeit surprisingly fast however attempting create playlist newly uploaded songs nomad froze refused work
made additional five attempts creating playlist packing unit heading amazons product return page
needless say wouldnt recommend anyone purchasing product
wonderful
started ripping transferring
product fragile normal use
however creative software real intuitive
software somewhat nice look using easiest
doubt use half storage capacity never know
description warranty buried supplied set cd
alludes manufacturers confidence product last year
interface used could better designed
software engineer wrote interface software worked like would hell pay mention ridicule peers
files could access player without removing battery waiting short period reinserting battery
would suspect similar problems brands somewhat new technology
player weeks returning exchange hopes locking problem scroll wheel problems particular unit
know unit problems future 40 year questions asked replacement warranty worth since creative warrant 90 days totally ridiculous
first let give bad things size little bit bigger ipod weighs little bit
scroll button isnt best sometimes hard select
otherwise youll mess around lot filenames inside decent nomad explorer fun
thing seriously good player though
sell adapter unit use cars cassette deck
wants wires involved
short range fm transmitter would much nicer
overall like
upgrade went smoothly easy follow directions
consider deciding bit rate want use much want put player
price along replaceable battery understand apple charges small fortune replace well hassle returning two main factors picked nomad
havent figured case songs itunes
appears player doesnt play well itunes
scroll bar scroll bar bit pain
sometimes skip past things press twice select items
software convert cds mp3 put player well hard disk want
edit genres songs play decide reclassify things later
pretty cool
thing great like use pick tough stains countertop also listen old 8track records
done lot research decided buy nomad zen xtra
one good thing 40 gb disk space well 38 gb reality
case navigation artist album ok however miss ability navigate folders
installing trying make working 30 minutes went bought notmad
players 4060 gb hard drive better organization required
downloaded trial version less 10 minutes using decided well worth price
unmatched quality beyond cool
30gb zen xtra rocks socks spills beer doesnt wash car
longer battery life greater accessibility online music services pc compatibility sensibilities
im considering using mine distraction winter boredom paintball fields
far complaints recommend anyone wants quality appearance also anyone wants harddrive based mp3 player wants pay next nothing
creative labs customer support website useless
great mp3 player
bought player today already love
clear blue light allows see everything screen easily
overall player awesome definately recommend
compared leading hdd mp3 players value per gb tops
unit easy use intuitive
structurally everything secure wont fall apart
case strong stylish unfortunately lacks window big deal
headphone earbuds average use regular pair instead
seems depending system software might work might work works computers
worked problem software mp3 player worth money cost
included eax support useful times especially listen variety genres adjust equalizer big hassle
eg 60 plastic box hold aaa batteries increase use time past 68 hrs reviewers figures uploaded drivers new software 15 minutes crashes problems
usb 20 fast yeah agree earbuds pretty crap replace
work automatically like hard drive connect computer like players suprisingly easy use
great player price
however doesnt register instantly hard drive like players
nomad hold type file mp3 use portable hard disk
found useful transferring large files another computer
cons navigation system zen xtra uses id3 tags embedded mp3 files organize songs
would much easier use windows explorer style navigation system
cant simply open folder player play songs
would nice simple fm receiver could pick local stations
player feels delicate im holding actual hard drive
top player thin metal piece covers battery removable
even reading instructions still hard figure
bit cumbersome cant get songs want quickly
simple click buttons back buttons volume display easy read access use
major problem software
tried make sense file transfer program got confused
think lack mp3 player able run without special software also downer becuase makes cumbersome people less computer illiterate
purchased player last week
little research web player decided
headphones arent best really expect much small headphones insert ear cavity
battery life seems good takes lttle time charge uploads mp3s quickly delay songs
took tries get use navigation user friendly player imo
software runs smooth nice look organized easy follow makes things simple
difficult manage large library
quickly discovered nomad wasnt going work
extremely cool gizmo
affordable better player windows
far ive since christmas cant tell much battery life
software people complain software please stop complaining
hook thing computer via usb cable machine instantly recognizes fact amp installs drivers
youre copying cds windows media really simple give songs id3 tags thats
oh file transfers fast amp easy
favorite thing nomad eax feature
every time move face something pop
stick pin something small reset button amp youre golden
people want buy ipod say ipod dont bother much better buy
id like start saying product using archos jukebox recorder made product great open source os called rockbox based hardware one could assume archos players horrible hardware standards fine men women took time create upstanding rockbox software archos became top notch player intuitive features wazoo come zen xtra first ill start saying players hardware pretty good sound indeed excellent form factore bad still rather larger expected really made mediocre mp3 player software
many people recommended ipod borrowed one friend
nomad jukebox three weeks happy
office would let put software work computer
reservations product concern tagging process way interacts software
perhaps weirdest one bruce springsteens cds tracks set classified goth rock
change need paying attention information downloaded copy
also cant understand software ignore lists cds alphabetical order
need computer however want add tracks playlist
zen versus ipod
hard drive computer fail better music backed somewhere gone
zen serves backup device well player
third creative software allows keep two windows open look content player computer
thing missing creative cd burner
itunes apple famous makes software works less computer saavy
us like tinker think creative offers advantages
create temporary playlist cant store permanently delete songs search easily etc
might get 40gb zen
thing would complain zen xtra controls arent easy ipods sexy looking
got player christmas amp first time using mp3 player
large collection cds loaded 100 far
software quick amp easy use amp found entire process easily mastered
unit works great cassette adapter car amp also easily worked without taking eyes road
256 mb player cost 40 gb 40000 mb player cost mp3 players either flash card memory hard drive
mp3 players kind memory typically small light 64 mb 15 gb memory
cheaper produce holds lot heavier moving parts means little prone damage banged around
thats first thing understand
reviewers noted connected computer bit somehow stopped reading player replug
software lets pop cd scans internet name artist track name album name
wont leave copy computer
slightly larger ipod doubt
reviewed manual pdf file included cd felt better warned message said wouldnt cause problems fact hasnt
would liked given 12 stars docking 12 star size
beast
wasnt runner would take bullet foot nomad jukebox
far difficult select songs easy use fly playlist creation new ipod mention doesnt sinc contact lists phone numbers address books ect
like ipod eliminated need kind palm device
everyone says cant buy ipod excessive use short time man made ipod battery life video admitted used extensively every day charged fully every night 18 months conditions rechargeable battery dies
alternative ipod one viable ones alternative would anyone seek alternative something really needs alternative choice theres nothing wrong everything right
gigantic flaw go unnoticed creative
rip everything 160 kbps wma file opposed 128 kbps mp3 avoid hearing digital garbling
provide enough volume connected larger headphones external receivers car radio
software absolutely terrible automatically transfer songs identical titles live albums greatest hits albums cause inordinate frustration
recognize player random times despite connected displaying players library
excellent way carry music collection
using method encountered situation track rejected plenty duplicate tracks live compilation albums
navigation could better isnt really anything zen xtra cant youve gotten comfortable
end day wanted largecapacity player allows easily play album collection wherever go zen xtras combination price capacity features easily meets criteria
got christmas great gift
considering price specs might best buy large memory mp3 player
two months ago internal part failed due customer abuse failed
creative offered 12month warranty mp3 players id covered
best ipod alternative
consideration chose 40gb nomad zen xtra creative disappointed
easy enough remove front plate one way battery could inserted
create playlists drag amp drop songs playlists player rip directly cd player
usb 20 transferring music player incredibly easy
plenty features havent checked im sure soon
keep pocket
thats real complaint nomad zen xtra though
important zen information
zen good points achieved basic objective entire cd collection portable device lots room store
mp3 players gap end one track start next annoying music intended continuous
btw ripping cds mediasource accesses cddb music catalog internet cds experimented provided good quality correct amp uncluttered tag information
turned eax static disappeared
unlucky moment
4the zen stores data files allow folder structure allow documents opened programs launched disk must copied another hard drive launched
mediasource install personal notebook
creative provided email support followed advice failed
experimented installing mediasource computers home worked fine
third party software rescue much frustration found notmad explorer cute product name software resolves virtually creative mediasource file transfer amp organization problems
given already zen reason happy notmad software
however cant imagine without
sound quality fantastic cd quality really great carry around instead stacks cds tapes
one plus napster supports device via software
whole bunch devices samesounding name long
minor gripe
great memory quality
may taken several years fill
software came tough load
cannot recommend enough
month warranty warning
id paying attention would noticed month warranty
took several days attempts things finally worked havent clue
doesnt leave good feeling future stability
means trying save hundred dollars ill end spending twice
purchased jukebox got fried recharged asked 20usd look said would charge repaing damned thing
also bought soundblaster card sold mac
pros great sound 98db signaltonoise ratio beats ipods unspecified ratio good power output allow zen xtra drive large headphones well external speakers
wakeup feature allows set player wake play selected music specified time
connected speakers nice musical alarm morning
problem older downloaded music files missing incorrect id3 information
unnecessary id3 tags people like organize music folders like zen audio files allow subfolders rely id3 tags
fm voice recording would nice extras
would liked able see playing without open case
experience got home first install creative mediasource figure transferred files player
also downloaded latest firmware upgrade software updates
thing job
felt better one since shuffle feature im keen
also feature automatically put song information isnt always accurate
discover later youre listening song wrong title causing rename everything
big hassle many would think
hold button deactivate buttons avoid accidents however enough reviewers complained hold button easily broken device cant used
construction quality difficult item
drop inches hard surface faceplate pops case
feedback creatives product support universally poor limited zen applies companys products
reviews sound quality generally universally positive
veteran zen users explained stop thats want
none perfect
special friends creative gave thing good sound quality great features long battery life unbeatable price
didnt abuse charged every day headphone jack sort fizzled
tried resetting tried every pair headphones house 10 pairs nothing worked
really need save buy thing amazon eventually gave full refund
bought rca mp3cd player im happy cheap worthwhile mp3 player coomes
software problem
fourth mp3 player creative nomad jukebox2 rio chie one third player creative
value comparing data storage price
battery recharge awesome thing recharges like 23 hours
different things choose kind playing interface see interface modern classical
11 music plays awesome never skips even run bit listen music without interruption
hours max
similarily priced 15gb ipod wouldnt nearly enough room
planes use splitter two headphones plugged two people sound equally good
accessing files artist album mostly look things artist easy intuitive
cons
horrible
bought notmad manager 25 file transfers easy drag drop songs stored id3 tags folders needs software computer transfer files window case nice case otherwise
bigger people grossly exaggerated size differences half inch longer 13 inch thicker newgeneration ipods
ive heard least equal
yet ensuring id3 tags order software actually bad people make actually turns really handy
dedicated music playing device anyway serves better
find song quicky artist album genre search
playlists generated fly bit clunky still really nice bonus using software bevy eq options
thing missing option adjust balance
inprogram id3 tag editing strong point well
problem use software
please consider much superior piece equipment plopping half grand ipod
function correctly unhelpful customer service
unfortunately loading 280 songs get player either connected busy
load songs customer service idea
buy product took perfect care player still died week lousy 90 day warranty ended
software good either driver trouble working sound blaster products dumb
however hard drive fail dropped
basically wat happened hard drive failed
good thing whole process im getting like 34 dollar amount back price difference bought
say
large capacity nomad owners load hundreds cds
fall love product
breaks
nomad sent back creative labs
im convinced experience many people posted experience product defectively designed hold normal use
lot good options
people say buy ipod pretty expensive also require send product back factory replace battery
maybe creative come better design although hard customers trust
maybe competitors bring similar products
whatever dont buy product
sorry
piece junk
